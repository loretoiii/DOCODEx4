PART I
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LIFE OF THE HERO, ODYSSEUS




CHAPTER I
ABOUT TROY AND THE JOURNEY OF PARIS TO GREECE


On the northern shore of Asia Minor there lies a plateau watered by
many small rivers and surrounded on all sides by mountains, only on
the north it slopes gently to the sea. On this plateau, between the
Simois and Scamandros rivers, in the oldest times there stood a very
rich and powerful city, whose name was Troy. It was the capital of
a large and fertile district, known as the Troad.

There, about 1200 B.C., reigned a king by the name of Priam, possessed
of great power and boundless wealth. He had many sons and daughters.
It was said, indeed, that he had fifty sons who were all married and
living in their own homes, which they had built by the king's wish
around the royal palace.

They were all handsome and heroic young men. One of the youngest,
Paris, also named Alexandros, surpassed the others in beauty. He was
a restless youth and not fond of his home, as were the others. He
had set his heart on travelling and seeing strange countries and
cities. King Priam was extremely fond of his large family, and took
pride in having all his children about him, so that at first he was
greatly opposed to the wishes of Paris.

But the youth was so persistent and unhappy that the king at last
consented to let him go. Without delay, Paris called together a few
friends with tastes as adventurous as his own. They embarked in a
new ship well provided with all that travellers need, and set sail
for the famous land on the shores of the Ægean Sea, of which they
had heard so many wonderful things, and which was called Hellas.

Nearly in the middle of the plain which forms the southern part of
Hellas was the city of Sparta. It was on the river Eurotas, and was
the capital of a large district called Lacedæmon, and it was to this
city that Paris came.

Now, there was a mysterious reason for this strange desire of
Paris--his passionate longing to travel. In his early youth, while
he was still minding his herds on the rich pastures of Mount Ida,
he received a visit from the three greatest goddesses of Olympos.

Hera, the queen of Heaven and consort of Zeus--Athena, the goddess
of wisdom, and Zeus's favorite daughter--and Aphrodite, the goddess
of love and beauty, had a dispute among themselves.

Each thought herself the most beautiful of the three, and they would
have come to high words about it had not Athena proposed that they
should ask the handsomest man in the world to settle the question.
This happened to be the young royal shepherd, Paris. So the three
goddesses floated down to the slope of Mount Ida on a snowy cloud
and placed the question before him, each promising to reward him
royally if he gave his verdict in her favor.

Paris, as might have been expected, decided in favor of Aphrodite,
who had promised him that the fairest woman living in the whole world
should be his wife. This promise had to be kept, being given by a
goddess, but it was the source of endless misfortune, for Paris had
a young and lovely wife who was tenderly attached to him, while the
fairest of living women--acknowledged as such by fame in all known
countries--was Queen Helen of Sparta, herself the wife of another
man.

Her husband was one of the most renowned heroes of Hellas, King
Menelaos, a son of Atreus and brother of the leader of the Greek chiefs,
Agamemnon, King of Mycenæ. It was Aphrodite, then, who inspired Paris
with an insane desire to forsake his parents, brothers, and wife.
It was her secret guidance which led him across the seas and through
the dangers lurking among the hundreds of islands of the Archipelagos
straight to the land of Lacedæmon. This is the central of the three
peninsulas in which the Peloponnesus ends, and might be called the
middle finger of that large hand of which Arcadia is the palm.

Paris landed, with all his companions, on the shores of Lacedæmon,
where the people received him kindly and helped him on his journey
to Sparta, where Menelaos and Helen gave him a cordial welcome.




CHAPTER II
THE FLIGHT OF HELEN


Aphrodite, while leading Paris to the shores of Lacedæmon, had not
forgotten her promise, and in Sparta itself she was at work at its
fulfilment. She inspired Queen Helen with a growing discontent and
restlessness of spirit. Menelaos had not noticed any change in her,
and it was with an utterly unsuspicious mind that he received the
fatal strangers and made them welcome guests in his land and home.

More than that, having heard the news from Crete that his presence
there was desirable on account of some urgent business, he did not
hesitate to set sail for that island, in the expectation of finding
Paris and his companions still enjoying the hospitality of his palace
after a short absence.

This was the chance which wily Aphrodite had contrived for Paris.
He took the hint and carried Helen away to his ship, together with
as much treasure as they could lay hands on, and then they sailed
for Troy. Little did he heed, in his mad desire to call the most
beautiful woman in the world his wife, that she was already the wife
of a hero who had received him as an honored guest in his house, and
that he was about to destroy the peace and honor of his host.

As soon as Menelaos heard of the flight of his wife, he hastened back
to Sparta, where he found his palace deserted and his treasure-house
robbed.

Then his heart was filled with great wrath. He set out at once to
see his brother, Agamemnon, to consult with him about what was to
be done. Agamemnon was ruler over Mycenæ, and highly respected in
all Hellas on account of his power and riches.

After the two brothers had talked over this grave affair, they
announced to all the leaders in Hellas the great and detestable crime,
and asked them for their assistance. All the king's chiefs of Hellas
lent a willing ear to this demand, for in this breach of hospitality,
committed against one of them, each felt himself personally aggrieved
and bound to help in the punishment of what, in those times, was
considered the most unpardonable of all crimes. Only one of the kings
held back for awhile and needed much persuasion to join the league.
This was Odysseus of Ithaca, who could well consider himself at the
time the happiest of mortals, for he had lately married Penelope,
one of the fairest and most virtuous maidens of Greece. He had an
infant son of great beauty and promise, and he owned much land and
countless herds of cattle, sheep, and swine. Added to that, all the
petty nobles of the island acknowledged him as their chief.

But a soothsayer, or seer, had greatly disturbed him by informing
him that if he went to a great war he would be kept away from his
home for the space of twenty years, and even then return to it in
the guise of a beggar, after having suffered wrecks, captivity,
endless wanderings, and loss of comrades.

No one could doubt that Odysseus was brave, but no one could blame
him for wishing to be excused from taking part in the war against
Troy. Menelaos and his brother, however, would accept no excuse from
him, as he was the wisest and craftiest of all the leaders, and when
Odysseus finally consented to join them he set about arming and
directing the young Greek warriors with all his heart and soul.

There was another young prince whom it was absolutely necessary to
secure, for a much venerated oracle had given it as a decree of the
gods that Troy could never be taken without his help. This was Achilles,
son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Thessaly, and of the beauteous
ocean nymph, Thetis. Notwithstanding his extreme youth, his father
would not disappoint the whole country, and he let him go with those
who came for him. But he sent along with him his adopted son, Patroklos,
who was several years older, and to whom the boy was passionately
attached, and also his oldest and most trusted servant, Phœnix. These
two, the old man and the youth, he charged, as they hoped for the
mercy of Zeus, to keep watchful guard over Achilles, whose exceedingly
impetuous and reckless temper exposed him to many dangers which might
be averted by a sensible and loving word spoken in time.

[Illustration: THE SILVER-FOOTED THETIS RISING FROM THE WAVES]

The Greeks took counsel together, and it was resolved that Menelaos
should go in person to Troy and demand back his wife, Helen, as well
as his treasure and a suitable apology for the wrong done to him and
to all Hellas. He chose for his companion the cunning Odysseus. On
their arrival in Troy, Menelaos and Odysseus presented themselves
before Priam and demanded the return of Helen and the treasures.

The king at once called his people together to deliberate upon the
matter, and the two Greek kings bravely denounced the mean act of
Paris. But the Trojans, stirred up by that youth, abused the
ambassadors and drove them out of their city.




CHAPTER III
THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY


The kings and chieftains of Hellas, having heard that Odysseus and
Menelaos had been driven out of Troy, hastened to call together their
fleets and armies at Aulis, a city of Bœotia on a ridge of rock running
out into the sea between two little bays, each of which was a harbor
for many ships. A hundred thousand men and a thousand ships were
gathered there under the leadership of the celebrated and heroic
chiefs. The commander-in-chief of the whole army was Agamemnon.

Among the renowned leaders were Menelaos, the sagacious Odysseus,
Ajax, and many others. Just as they were offering a sacrifice to the
gods, in order to start out to the war with their good will, a great
miracle happened. A fearful snake crept from under the altar and
climbed a tree in which there was a sparrow's nest nearly hidden by
the leaves. There were eight young sparrows in the nest, nine birds
with the mother. The snake devoured the fluttering little birds,
around which the mother circled as if overcome by grief.

Then the snake darted at the mother-bird and swallowed it, when Zeus
changed the reptile into a stone. The Greeks wondered at the sight,
but the soothsayer, Calchas, said to them: "Why do ye wonder at this?
The all-powerful Zeus has sent us this sign because our deeds shall
live forever in the minds of men. Just as the snake has devoured the
eight little sparrows and their mother, so shall the war swallow up
the nine coming years, and in the tenth we shall overcome Troy."

The ships of the Greeks lay in the bays of Aulis while the warriors
waited impatiently to set sail. But the winds were contrary; they
would not blow, and the boats waited there year after year; for a
sacred hind had been slain by Agamemnon, one that belonged to the
goddess Artemis, and it was ordered by that goddess that no wind should
arise to take them on toward Troy until her wrath had been appeased.

So Agamemnon went to Calchas, the seer, and asked his advice,
whereupon the old prophet told him to send for his lovely young
daughter, Iphigeneia, and offer her up on the altar as the only
acceptable sacrifice to Artemis. When he had placed her upon the altar
and the priest was raising his knife, the goddess took pity on
Agamemnon and carried the girl away in a cloud, leaving a fine white
doe instead.

[Illustration: ODYSSEUS AND MENELAOS PERSUADING AGAMEMNON TO
SACRIFICE IPHIGENEIA]

And now arose a favorable wind, and the Greeks arrived safely before
Troy. How they fought with the Trojans, how many of the heroes outlived
the struggle, and how many fell in the battle, all this we can learn
from an old book called the "Iliad." We shall select from it only
those things which refer to our hero, Odysseus; and to complete the
history of that hero we shall go to another book, called the "Odyssey."

Both of these books are the work of the great poet Homer, who lived
many years after the war with Troy. That we may understand better
what happened later on, we must give a short account of the fall of
Troy and of the return of Menelaos and Agamemnon to their own country.




CHAPTER IV
THE FALL OF TROY


The war lasted nine years, and in the tenth the Greeks conquered Troy,
not in battle, but by means of a trick which had come into the mind
of Odysseus. He told a skilful carpenter to build a wooden horse of
gigantic size, and in it he hid the bravest Greek warriors. When he
had done this he advised all the other Greeks to depart without leaving
anything behind them, and so lead the Trojans to believe that they
had given up the fight and gone home.

So the Greeks burned their tents and put off to sea, while the Trojans
from their walls watched them with great joy, thinking themselves
well rid of an enemy. When the last ship had gone, the Trojans threw
open the gates of their city and rushed down into the plain where
the Greeks had had their camp, to see how the place looked.

There they found the wooden horse, and one of the Greeks tied to a
tree, who told them he was left there as a punishment, and that the
wooden horse was an offering to the gods. The Trojans made up their
minds to carry it into their city and give it the best place on their
highest hill.

Then Laocoön, a priest of Apollo, stepped forth, and said to them:
"Unhappy people! what madness possesses you? Do ye think the enemy
gone? Do ye know Odysseus so little? There are Greek warriors hidden
in this horse, or else some other mischief is lurking there. Fear
the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

With these words, he thrust his spear into the flank of the horse,
and the arms of the hidden enemy clashed with a loud noise. Just then
two snakes of great size, sent by Athena, rose from the sea, and sprang
upon Laocoön and his two sons, and, coiling around them, bit them
to death. The Trojans, in great fear at the sight, took this as a
sign from the gods that the horse was sacred and that they must protect
it, and they moved it at once into their city, breaking down a part
of their wall to get it in.

Having done this, they gave themselves up to feasting and making merry,
without the slightest thought that any evil was in store for them.
But when night had come, and all were in a deep sleep, the ships of
the Greeks, which had been hiding all the while behind a neighboring
island, came back. The warriors who were concealed in the wooden horse
sprang out and rushing wildly through the city, slew the Trojans right
and left without mercy. From all sides came wailings and groans, and
the flames of the burning city rose up to the sky.

A deadly struggle took place between the Trojans and the Greeks. Priam
was slain, and Paris and many other heroes. The victory was to the
Greeks. Troy fell never to rise again, and the women and children
were led off to become slaves to their conquerors.

Thus was destroyed in one night the great and glorious city of Troy,
all on account of the crime which Paris had committed against the
laws of hospitality.

The trials of the Greeks were not yet at an end. After their victory
at Troy they embarked in their ships and started eagerly for their
homes. But Zeus prepared a sad fate for them, because Ajax had
violently dragged Cassandra, the beautiful daughter of Priam, from
the altar of Athena and had made her his slave. Thus many of the leaders
perished in the sea far from home, and some were cast on foreign shores
to die.

Menelaos was thrown by wind and waves on the island of Crete, and
he lost many of the ships on the cliffs. Thence he strayed to the
island of Cyprus, noted for its mines; and he roved through other
lands until he came to Egypt, where he wandered about for eight years,
when he returned to Sparta, taking Helen with him. He became
reconciled to his wife, and they lived a quiet life far removed from
the enchantments of the wily Aphrodite.

But the saddest fate of all overtook Agamemnon, who met his death
in his own house at the hands of his wife and brother.

Agamemnon, without any accident at sea, reached his native land. Full
of gratitude, he kissed the earth and wept tears of joy at the thought
of meeting his wife and son.

He entered his home with a glad heart, and his faithless wife came
to meet him, but she had prepared a hot bath for him, and there he
met his death, entangled in a net which she threw over him, for she
had not forgotten the loss of her beautiful daughter, Iphigeneia,
whom she believed to have been offered up as a sacrifice on the altar
of Artemis.

She was assisted in this dreadful deed by her husband's brother, who
became ruler over the land, holding sway eight years, when Orestes,
the son of Agamemnon, slew him and regained the kingdom.

And now we come to the return of Odysseus, the wisest of the Greeks,
who wandered to the remotest part of the earth and learned the customs
of many people, and who suffered terrible things by land and sea.




PART II
THE RETURN OF ODYSSEUS TO HIS OWN COUNTRY




CHAPTER V
ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO


All the Greeks who had escaped from the destruction of Troy and had
been spared the terrors of the sea returned to their homes. But the
unfortunate Odysseus was delayed by the fair nymph Calypso on her
island, where she made her home in a cool and beautiful grotto. There
he wept and mourned, desiring to see his wife again and his native
land. Each of the gods save one, Poseidon, god of the sea, wished
to help him to find the way home. Odysseus had brought Poseidon's
wrath upon himself through inflicting a terrible injury upon the
favorite son of that deity, and for that reason the wrath of the god
fell on him and he was wrecked. One day all the other gods had assembled
in the hall of Zeus, on Mount Olympos, when Athena, the favorite
daughter of Zeus and firm friend of Odysseus, knowing that her father
in his heart was well-disposed toward the hero, began to plead for
him in a way to excite greater pity still.

"O my father, thou great king among the gods," she said, "my heart
is troubled on account of the wise Odysseus, who lingers on an island,
far away from home, and suffers greatly; for a nymph lives on the
island, the daughter of great Atlas, and with sweet words she strives
to make Odysseus forget his native land. But he bewails his fate and
is full of sorrow, his only wish being to have a glimpse of the smoke
of his beloved country."

Zeus thereupon ordered Hermes to depart at once for the island and
tell the nymph to send Odysseus to his home without delay. Hermes
obeyed quickly. He bound his winged sandals to his feet, and, taking
his golden wand in his hand, flew like a meteor over land and sea
till he reached the island where the nymph Calypso made her abode.
He found her within the grotto, singing sweetly while she wove a fine
web on a golden loom.

All about the grotto there was a grove of cypress-trees in which birds
of gay colors were sporting and springs of pure water bubbling, and
the fragrance of strange flowers filled the air. When Hermes had gazed
upon these wonders he entered the grotto. It was bright with a blazing
fire on a spacious hearth, and fragrant with the odor of burning cedar
and cypress.

Calypso saw him as he came in and knew him. She bade him sit down
on a throne dazzling with jewels, and, placing a table before him
laden with nectar and ambrosia, invited him to eat and drink. After
he had finished his repast, Hermes told her that Zeus had sent him
to her with the command that she should send Odysseus without delay
to his native land. Having given this message, he disappeared, leaving
Calypso in great grief.

Odysseus in the meantime sat by the shore mourning and gazing out
upon the sea. Calypso found him there, sitting alone, weeping and
longing for his home. She stood by him and said: "Odysseus, my unhappy
friend, do not waste thy life any longer in sorrow. The end of thy
grief has come. Arise and prepare to depart for thy home. Build thee
a raft of the trunks of trees which thou shalt hew down. I will put
bread and water and delicate wine on board; and I will clothe thee
in comfortable garments, and send a favorable wind that thou mayest
safely reach thy native land."

Thus spoke the lovely goddess, but Odysseus could hardly believe her,
and said: "I fear, O goddess, that thou hast some other thought in
thy mind, and that thou dost not wish to send me home when thou biddest
me sail over this stormy and dangerous sea. I shall never go on to
the raft against thy wish, and thou must swear the great oath of the
gods that no harm shall come to me."

The goddess smiled at these words, and, taking the hero by the hand,
rejoined: "Thou art a wise man, and thy answer is well made. I will
pledge thee a solemn oath, by the heavens and the earth, and the waters
of the Styx, that I have no plan of evil against thee. And I advise
thee to do as I have instructed thee, to be ready for any crisis."

Speaking thus, the goddess went into the grotto and Odysseus followed
her. When he had come into the spacious hall, he sat down on his throne
and the nymph brought him rich food and wine. Then she took a seat
opposite him, and her attendants brought her ambrosia and nectar,
which she would gladly have shared with Odysseus, that he, too, might
become an immortal.

When the repast was over, Calypso narrated to him all the trials he
would have to undergo before he could reach his native land. While
she was relating these things the sun sank down, and darkness came
upon the island, and all who had their abode in the grotto sought
rest and slumber.




CHAPTER VI
ODYSSEUS CONSTRUCTS A RAFT AND LEAVES THE ISLAND


At daybreak the goddess gave Odysseus a large axe and a sharp adze,
and led him to the heights of the island, where the largest trees
grew. He went to work at once and cut down twenty trees, which he
hewed into proper shape, and then tied them together with ropes which
he himself made of bark.

In this way he built a raft which was very large and strong enough
to stand the onset of the waves. He wove a railing of willow and fitted
it around the sides of the raft, to protect himself against the dashing
waves; and he raised a strong mast with sails shaped to it, and tightly
bound by cords and ropes. He filled the crevices of the raft with
wax and pitch and attached a rudder.

At the end of the fourth day his work was all done, and his little
ship was ready to be launched. On the fifth day the beautiful goddess
prepared the hero a bath and gave him new garments fragrant with
perfumes. She went down to the boat with him and put on board a skin
of dark-red wine, a larger one full of water, and a bag of dainty
food. Then she bade Odysseus a kind farewell, and sent a gentle and
friendly wind to waft him over the waves.

Odysseus was wild with joy at the thought that he was really on his
way home once more. He spread his sails to catch the breeze and took
his seat at the helm, steering the vessel with great skill. He did
not dare to take any sleep, for he had to watch the sky and stars
constantly and use them as guides on his course. He sailed along in
this way seventeen days. On the eighteenth he spied land in the
distance. It was the land of the Phæacians, lying like a dark spot
off in the sea.

Then Poseidon, who was returning from Ethiopia, saw him, and his wrath
grew hot against the hero. He raised up his head and said to himself:
"Alas! the gods have strangely changed their minds about Odysseus
during my absence in Africa. Behold! in a little while he will be
in the land of the Phæacians, where he will find an end to his troubles.
Nevertheless, it is in my power to chastise him."

Speaking thus, Poseidon called the clouds together, and seizing his
trident he stirred up the sea; then he set loose all the winds until
there was a general hurricane, and he wrapped heaven and earth in
the thick darkness of night.

The mighty waves dashed over the raft, and Odysseus sank on his knees
and trembled. With a deep groan he said: "Ah me, unhappy! Am I to
bear more disasters? I fear that the warning of the goddess was too
true, and that I shall be for a long time cast about on the waves
before I reach home. With what dark clouds Zeus has shrouded the sky!
The storm grows wild. What terrible waves are these! Helplessly I
must perish. Happy the Greeks who fell before Troy, fighting for their
country! Would that I, too, had met death the day when the Trojans
hurled their spears at me as they strove to take the body of Achilles.
If I had died then, the Greeks would have buried me with great honors.
Now I shall die an inglorious death."

As he spoke a huge wave struck the raft with such terrible force that
it whirled it around and overturned it. The helm was wrung from his
hand and he fell into the angry breakers. The mast was snapped in
two and the ropes and sails flew off into the sea.

Odysseus was under water a long time, striving in vain to come to
the surface. Finally he rose, spitting the bitter brine out of his
mouth. Although he was in such a desperate plight, his mind was on
the raft. Battling bravely with the waves he reached it, and springing
on board sat down in the middle of it. Thus he escaped death.

The angry waves tossed him hither and thither as the wind scatters
the leaves over a field. Then Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, saw him
and took pity on him. She took the form of a bird, and, perching on
his raft, she said to him: "O, luckless man! why is Poseidon so angry
with thee? Fear nothing, however; he cannot take thy life. Obey me
and thou shalt not suffer much longer. Lay aside thy clothes, leave
the raft to the mercy of the winds and waves, and swim to the land.
Take my veil and wind it about thy breast, and thou shalt not have
anything to fear. As soon as thou hast reached the land, take it off
and throw it back into the sea. Then hurry away inland."

Odysseus hesitated to follow Ino's advice, fearing some treachery.
But Poseidon sent a huge wave which struck him and scattered the raft
as if it were dry chaff. Then Odysseus at once got astride of the
swimming timber. He bound the veil around his breast and bravely
plunged into the boiling waters.

Poseidon saw him, and shaking his head he said: "I verily believe
thou wilt come out alive from the sea. But the sea has had thee long
enough, so that thou wilt know its power hereafter and fear it." Saying
this he lashed up his horses and drove off.




CHAPTER VII
ODYSSEUS IS SAVED ON THE ISLAND OF SCHERIA


Athena, the daughter of Zeus, seeing Odysseus struggling through the
waves, pitied him, and bade the winds become quiet. Two days and two
nights Odysseus floated about, but on the third the wind calmed down
and the sea became smooth.

In a short time he found himself near land once more. But the shore
was wild and full of sharp rocks and high cliffs. He could see no
place on which to set foot, and he grew downhearted. His knees gave
way, and, groaning deeply, he cried out: "O, luckless one! In vain
have I braved the dangers of the sea to escape death. Now all hope
has abandoned me, since there is no way for me to get out of the water.
I fear that when I try to approach the land the waves will throw me
against the cliffs, and should I try to find a safe landing-place
by swimming, the surf may carry me back into the wild sea, where some
sea-monster will swallow me up. Whatever I may do, I see no help for
me."

While he pondered over these things a huge wave cast him on the foamy
shore. His bones were nearly broken, and he lay exhausted until the
wave returned, when he was hurled again with great force back into
the sea. Now the unfortunate wanderer took to swimming as his last
resort, and reached the mouth of a river, where he was able to land.

Too tired to breathe or speak, he sank down in a swoon. His knees
and arms trembled, and his whole body was bruised and swollen. When
his senses returned he rose and untied the veil that Ino had given
him and cast it back into the sea. Then he knelt down and kissed the
earth, and moved to a sheltered spot where a wild and a tame olive-tree
were standing close together, whose branches had mingled with one
another, and there he found a safe hiding-place.

Then the godlike Odysseus lay down on a bed of dry leaves, covering
himself up as one does an ember, lest it should go out. Athena came
and poured sweet sleep over his eyes, that he might find quiet rest
after all his toils.




CHAPTER VIII
NAUSICAÄ IS SENT TO THE RIVER BY ATHENA


While Odysseus lay in a deep sleep, the goddess Athena went to the
royal dwelling of the king of the Phæacians, Alkinoös, in order to
hasten the return of Odysseus to his native land. She entered the
house, where she found Nausicaä, the king's daughter, sleeping in
her beautiful chamber. Near her lay two maids who served her.

Athena came as softly as a breath of air, and caused the maiden to
dream that her marriage-day was near and that it was her duty to arise
and hasten to the place by the river where they washed their clothing.
In her dream the princess seemed to hear Athena say: "Nausicaä, why
art thou so slothful? Thy beautiful robes lie neglected and thy
wedding-day is at hand, on which thou surely shouldst wear garments
of dazzling whiteness, and thou shouldst give such garments to those
maidens who lead thee forth to thy bridegroom. Therefore, as soon
as day breaks thou must ask thy father to give thee a pair of mules,
and we will hasten to the washing-place down by the river."

At the first dawn of day Nausicaä went in haste to her father and
mother to tell them of her dream. She found them in their splendid
hall. Her mother sat with her maidens spinning, and the king stood
on the threshold, just going forth to meet his chiefs in council.
The princess approached her father and said: "Dearest father, I pray
that thou wilt give me two mules and a wagon, that I may go with my
maids to the river and take all the clothes that need washing, for
it becomes the king and his sons to wear clean garments when they
go to the council of the chiefs. Thou hast five sons, three of whom
are youths not wedded, and they should be provided with fresh robes;
they will need them in the dance."

The king smiled, for he saw what was in her mind, and he ordered the
mules. Then his beautiful daughter brought from the linen-room the
soiled garments and put them on the wagon, while the queen prepared
a goodly lunch of cold meat and bread and a skin of sweet wine.

Nausicaä further received from her mother a bottle of fragrant oil
with which to anoint herself after the washing. Then she mounted the
wagon, seized the whip and reins, and drove out of the city, the
maidens of her train following her on foot.

When they came to the place where the river was flowing bright and
clear, they unhitched the mules and let them browse along the bank.
Then they took their garments down from the wagon and tossed them
into the marble vats which they had filled with the limpid water of
the stream. When they had washed them clean they spread them on the
white pebbles to dry. Having finished the task, they took a bath and
anointed themselves with oil. Then they sat down on the shore and
ate their lunch.

The repast over, they began to play ball. First the white-armed
Nausicaä threw the ball. She looked as tall and royal among her maids
as did Artemis, the daughter of Zeus, among her nymphs.

Nausicaä sang a song as they frolicked on the sand.

When it was time to go home they put the clean garments upon the wagon
and harnessed up the mules. Just as they started, Nausicaä once more
threw the ball to one of the maidens, who failed to catch it. The
ball rebounded from the rocks and fell into the river, at which the
girls raised such a shout that Odysseus, who was sleeping close by,
awoke.

He opened his eyes and sat up, saying to himself: "Woe is me! Have
I reached a country where people dwell? Are they wild and inhospitable,
or friendly to the stranger and god-fearing? It seems to me I heard
cries of women. Perhaps they were those of the nymphs who inhabit
the mountain heights, the springs of rivers, and the green meadows,
or those of people who live near by. But I will see who they are."

So Odysseus clothed himself as best he could, by winding slender
branches covered with leaves about him, and left the thicket where
he was hidden. He went in the direction of the voices, stalking along
like a great lion. When the girls saw him they shrieked and scattered
in every direction. Nausicaä alone stood her ground, for Athena gave
her courage. When Odysseus saw her he wondered which would be the
better, to throw himself at the feet of the maiden and beg her to
give him some clothes and to show him the way to the city, or to speak
to her with more formality.

It seemed better to him to remain at a distance, and so he addressed
her gently, saying: "O queen, I know not whether thou art a goddess
or a woman. If thou art a goddess, I should take thee to be Artemis,
because thou art so tall and graceful. If, however, thou art a mortal,
thrice happy thy father and honored mother. Greatly must they rejoice
when they see their beautiful child in the choral dance. But he will
be the happiest who shall win thee for a bride.

"I once saw a young palm-tree growing up beside Apollo's altar in
the island of Dēlos. It was the most beautiful tree the earth ever
produced, and I gazed upon it with wonder and reverence. So am I amazed
at thy beauty, and I fear to approach thee and throw myself as a
suppliant at thy feet, although I am in sore distress, for great
misfortunes have befallen me.

"It was only last night that I escaped from the sea. On my way from
Calypso's isle I was driven about for twenty days by the angry waves
in a violent storm. Now some god has cast me on this shore to make
me undergo new trials, for I do not believe my sufferings have come
to an end. Have pity on me, O queen, because thou art the first human
being I have met after so many misfortunes.

"I do not know one person in this country. Show me thy city, I pray,
and give me an old robe to wear, no matter how coarse and poor, and
may the gods bestow all blessings upon thee."

Nausicaä looked at Odysseus in pity and answered: "Stranger, thou
dost not seem to me to be a man of mean birth or breeding, and thou
art surely in distress. But it is Zeus who distributes gifts to mortals,
both the good and the evil things of life, and thou must submit to
his will with patience.

"Since thou hast come into our land devoid of all things, even garments,
and art helpless, I will give thee clothing and tell thee the way
to the city. And I will tell thee about the people living in it, for
I am the daughter of the king, Alkinoös, who reigns over this island."
When Nausicaä had spoken thus to Odysseus, she turned to her maids
and commanded them not to flee from the wanderer, but to bring him
food and drink, since Zeus sent the poor and the stranger to be cared
for.

And she told them to lead him to some lonely spot by the side of the
river, where he might bathe at his ease. So the maids came back and
led the hero to a sheltered place and laid a cloak and tunic on the
sand, and the bottle of oil which the queen had given Nausicaä, that
Odysseus might anoint and clothe himself after his bath; then they
ran back to the princess.

Odysseus bathed in the fresh water of the river and washed the salt
sea-foam from his hair, and when the bath was over he put on the robes
that Nausicaä had sent. Athena shed a halo of beauty over him and
caused him to look taller and stronger than before.

As he walked along the beach to rejoin the maidens, they admired his
noble and kingly bearing, and Nausicaä said to her maids: "Surely
this man does not come among our godlike brothers against the will
of the gods. I thought him rough and homely, but now he seems like
one of the immortals. I would that I might call a man like him my
husband. Make haste to give him food and wine, for he has fasted a
long time."

The maids hastened to obey. They looked over what was left of the
abundant lunch and bade Odysseus eat and drink, which he was glad
to do. The princess then yoked up the mules and they started for home.




CHAPTER IX
ODYSSEUS ARRIVES AT THE PALACE OF ALKINOÖS


After Nausicaä had mounted to her seat on the cart, she said to
Odysseus: "Get ready now, stranger, and we will lead thee to my
father's palace, where thou wilt meet the chiefs of the Phæacians.
If thou art wise, take well to heart what I shall say to thee. As
long as we are at a good distance from the city there is no harm in
going along with us. Just follow close to the wagon with my maids.

"But when we come near to the town thou must go more slowly and tarry
behind a little, till we have reached my father's hall, because I
dread the gossip of the baser sort of people whom we may meet. After
thou hast seen us enter the city, then thou mayest enter it also and
inquire the way to the king's palace. It is very beautiful. Thou mayest
easily find it by thyself, for there is no other house in the city
as large as ours.

"Enter at once and find my mother and sue to her for protection and
help, that thou mayest reach thy native land and thy dear ones again."

Having spoken these words, Nausicaä touched the mules with her long
whip and they quickly left the river, wending their way toward the
city. They reached it at sunset, but Odysseus sat down in the sacred
grove of Athena, outside of the city to wait, and prayed to the goddess
that he might receive pity from the people of Phæacia.

While he prayed, the damsels went on and soon reached the king's palace.
Nausicaä's brothers came out and welcomed them, and unhitched the
mules. When Odysseus had given them time to get home, he arose and
found his way to the town. He had hardly entered it when Athena, in
the form of a young girl carrying a pitcher of water, met him.

"My daughter," Odysseus said to her, "canst thou show me the way to
the king's palace? I am a stranger, and here for the first time."
Athena answered him: "With pleasure, stranger; the king is our
neighbor. Follow me, and I will lead thee thither. But on the way
do not greet anyone or ask questions, for the people here are not
fond of those who come from other lands."

Thus spoke Athena and pursued her way with Odysseus following her.
She threw a veil of darkness over the hero to hide him from rude gazers.
Odysseus beheld the beautiful port with astonishment--the large
ships, the great market-place, and the high walls of the city.

When they reached the palace, the girl stopped and said: "This is
the house of the king. Go in without any fear, for they love brave
men, even when they come from afar. The first thing to do is to find
the queen, whose name is Aretè.

"She is greatly honored by the king, and all the people treat her
as if she were a goddess, on account of her gentleness and virtue.
In case the queen looks upon thee with favor, thou mayest be sure
of safely reaching home."

Having spoken these words, the goddess took a friendly leave of the
hero, and he entered the outer hall of Alkinoös, where he was
bewildered by the splendor. The walls were of brass, the doors of
gold, and the thresholds and lintels of pure silver. On each side
of the main entrance gold and silver dogs stood guard. They were
endowed with life and were immortal, the work and gift of the divine
Hephæstus.

There were two rows of splendid seats in the large dining-hall. They
were covered with costly mats, and the Phæacian leaders were wont
to sit there and enjoy themselves. Golden statues of boys with lighted
torches in their hands stood on beautiful pedestals and spread light
over the merry banquets. There were fifty maid-servants in the palace.
Some of them were grinding corn in the mill. Some spent their time
in spinning and weaving, for as the men were renowned sailors, the
women also were famous for making fine cloth.

There was a large orchard all around the palace, surrounded by a thick
hedge. In the orchard there was a great variety of fruit-trees--pear,
apple, pomegranate, olive, and fig. The trees were never bare of fruit,
either in summer or in winter, for an ever-blowing west wind created
such a mild climate that the trees were constantly blooming and
ripening their fruit.

There was to be seen a tree full of blossoms, while another bent down
under the load of ripe fruit. Thus it was with the grape-vines in
the vineyard close to the orchard. Some were blooming, others had
only begun to form fruit-buds, while some were loaded with ripe
clusters ready for the wine-press. At the end of the orchard there
was a magnificent flower-garden, in which the most fragrant flowers
were blooming. Two springs also bubbled from the ground. One watered
the orchard, and the other ran to the very door of the palace, and
all the people filled their pitchers there. Such were the gifts
Alkinoös had received from the gods.




CHAPTER X
ODYSSEUS IN THE HALLS OF ALKINOÖS


After Odysseus had contemplated these wonders to his heart's content,
he entered the main hall. There he found the leaders of the Phæacians
bringing offerings of wine to Hermes, as the hour of sleep had arrived,
and this was always their last ceremony before seeking slumber. No
one saw Odysseus as he crossed the spacious room and came close to
the king and queen, for he was still concealed in the thick mist which
Athena had thrown round him. Suddenly the cloud vanished, and Odysseus
threw himself at the feet of Aretè, and raised his voice in
supplication.

"Aretè," he prayed, "I have come to thy husband and to thy feet through
many hardships and sorrows. May the gods give thee a long and happy
life. For many years I have been a wanderer from home and all I love.
I beg that thou wilt give me a guide and send me to my own land."

When Odysseus had spoken these words he sat down amidst the ashes,
close to the fire, and all the guests grew silent and looked at him
with wonder. Then the oldest of the chiefs arose and said: "Alkinoös,
this is not a royal seat for a stranger, among the cinders of the
hearth. I pray thee, raise him up and place him on a throne, and order
the heralds to fill a cup with wine, that we may pour a libation to
Zeus, the protector of suppliants, and bid the guest welcome to our
good cheer."

Then Alkinoös arose and took Odysseus by the hand. He led him to a
splendid throne but little lower than his own, while the herald placed
a table before him loaded with dainty food. When Odysseus had eaten
and drunk, the attendants filled the cups to pour libations in honor
of Zeus, and Alkinoös said to them: "Listen, ye leaders and chiefs
of the Phæacians. To-morrow we shall greet the stranger in our palace
with honors and offer a great sacrifice to the gods. And then we will
consider the best way of sending him home. But if we should find that
he is a god instead of a mortal, we will do what seems best, for the
gods do sometimes visit us in human shape."

Then said Odysseus: "Nay, Alkinoös, I am not a god, nor like the gods
in form or looks. I am only a wanderer, and I could tell of fearful
sorrows; and I would willingly die if I could only see my home once
more."

The guests all greeted Odysseus with approving words, and promised
to aid him. Then they rose, and each man went to his own home.

Odysseus remained in the hall with Aretè and Alkinoös. As they
conversed, the queen noticed the garments of Odysseus, because she
had woven them herself, and she said to him: "Stranger, who art thou,
and from what land? Didst thou not say thou hadst come here after
many wanderings and voyages on the stormy sea? Who gave thee garments
of my weaving?"

Odysseus answered her: "It would not be easy, gracious queen, to tell
about all my hardships and sufferings. Yet I will do thy bidding.
I was shipwrecked long since, and thrown upon an island far out in
the sea, where Calypso, the daughter of Atlas, lives. She cared for
me most kindly, and would have made me, like herself, an immortal,
but I chose instead the hope of seeing my own native land.

"The goddess detained me seven long years on her island before she
bade me start for home. I built a raft, which she stored with food,
and she sent a pleasant breeze to carry me across the waters. But
Poseidon stirred the winds and waves against me, and I was thrown
upon the shores of this island, near the lavers, where thy daughter
and her maids went to wash the household linen. There the princess
found me, and supplied me with food and the garments I have on."

"One duty my daughter left undone," Alkinoös said. "She should have
brought thee home with her." "Do not blame her, I entreat," replied
Odysseus, "for she bade me come with her maids, but I lingered in
a grove to offer a prayer to Athena." When Alkinoös had heard this
tale from Odysseus, he promised once more to give him a ship and
sailors to escort him home.

Meanwhile the queen bade her servants prepare a bed for the hero out
on the portico, and they covered a couch with shaggy rugs and purple
tapestries, where he could rest. With a grateful heart Odysseus arose,
and, thanking the king for his generous hospitality, sought the bed,
where he gave himself to happy dreams.

Odysseus rose early the next morning and went with Alkinoös to the
market-place, close to the sea, where all the Phæacians had assembled.
The people gazed with admiration at their stranger-guest, for Athena
lent him greater dignity and beauty, and she went among the crowds,
moving their hearts to sympathy with him.

Alkinoös then addressed the assembled multitude: "Hear me, ye chiefs
of the Phæacians," he said. "This stranger has come to our land after
many wanderings and adventures. And he asks me to send him back to
his own country. Let us fit out a ship for him quickly and launch
it, and give him fifty-two young men from among our best sailors,
who shall get everything ready for the long journey.

"While they are doing this the stranger shall come to my halls with
the chiefs and princes, where we will make a great banquet. Summon
also the bard, Demodokos, that he may enliven the festival with his
harp and songs."

Having spoken, Alkinoös rose and led his guest back to the palace,
the princes following him. Fifty-two youths were soon chosen from
among the best seamen, and they launched a ship speedily and went
up to the royal palace.
