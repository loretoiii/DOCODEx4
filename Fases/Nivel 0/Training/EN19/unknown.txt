CHAPTER 1

MY name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader in
sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal grandfather was
an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in every thing, and had
speculated very successfully in stocks of the Edgarton New Bank, as it
was formerly called. By these and other means he had managed to lay by a
tolerable sum of money. He was more attached to myself, I believe, than
to any other person in the world, and I expected to inherit the most
of his property at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to
the school of old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of
eccentric manners--he is well known to almost every person who has
visited New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I
left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became intimate
with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who generally sailed in the
employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh--Mr. Barnard is also very well known in
New Bedford, and has many relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son
was named Augustus, and he was nearly two years older than myself. He
had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and
was always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific Ocean.
I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day, and sometimes
all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would be sure to keep me
awake until almost light, telling me stories of the natives of the
Island of Tinian, and other places he had visited in his travels. At
last I could not help being interested in what he said, and by degrees
I felt the greatest desire to go to sea. I owned a sailboat called the
Ariel, and worth about seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or
cuddy, and was rigged sloop-fashion--I forget her tonnage, but she would
hold ten persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the
habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I
now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am alive
to-day.

I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a
longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party at Mr.
Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little intoxicated
toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I took part of his
bed in preference to going home. He went to sleep, as I thought, very
quietly (it being near one when the party broke up), and without saying
a word on his favorite topic. It might have been half an hour from the
time of our getting in bed, and I was just about falling into a doze,
when he suddenly started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he
would not go to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was
so glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished in
my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the wines and
liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself. He proceeded
to talk very coolly, however, saying he knew that I supposed him
intoxicated, but that he was never more sober in his life. He was only
tired, he added, of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog, and
was determined to get up and dress, and go out on a frolic with the
boat. I can hardly tell what possessed me, but the words were no sooner
out of his mouth than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and
pleasure, and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most
reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and the
weather was very cold--it being late in October. I sprang out of bed,
nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was quite as brave
as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog,
and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any Augustus Barnard in
Nantucket.

We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat.
She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the lumber-yard of Pankey &
Co., and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs. Augustus
got into her and bailed her, for she was nearly half full of water. This
being done, we hoisted jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly
out to sea.

The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The night
was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I stationed
myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew along at a great
rate--neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the
wharf. I now asked my companion what course he intended to steer, and
what time he thought it probable we should get back. He whistled for a
few minutes, and then said crustily: “_I_ am going to sea--_you_ may go
home if you think proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once
that, in spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated.
I could see him distinctly by the light of the moon--his face was
paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he could
scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something had gone
wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I knew little
about the management of a boat, and was now depending entirely upon the
nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had suddenly increased, as
we were fast getting out of the lee of the land--still I was ashamed
to betray any trepidation, and for almost half an hour maintained a
resolute silence. I could stand it no longer, however, and spoke to
Augustus about the propriety of turning back. As before, it was nearly
a minute before he made answer, or took any notice of my suggestion.
“By-and-by,” said he at length--“time enough--home by-and-by.” I had
expected a similar reply, but there was something in the tone of these
words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again
looked at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and
his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to
stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now heartily frightened,
“what ails you?--what is the matter?--what _are_ you going to do?”
 “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest apparent surprise, letting go
the tiller at the same moment, and falling forward into the bottom of
the boat--“matter--why, nothing is the--matter--going home--d--d--don’t
you see?” The whole truth now flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised
him up. He was drunk--beastly drunk--he could no longer either stand,
speak, or see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go
in the extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the
bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that, during
the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and that his
conduct in bed had been the result of a highly-concentrated state of
intoxication--a state which, like madness, frequently enables the victim
to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his
senses. The coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual
effect--the mental energy began to yield before its influence--and the
confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation
had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now thoroughly
insensible, and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for
many hours.

It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The fumes
of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly timid and
irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of managing the
boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to
destruction. A storm was evidently gathering behind us; we had neither
compass nor provisions; and it was clear that, if we held our present
course, we should be out of sight of land before daybreak. These
thoughts, with a crowd of others equally fearful, flashed through my
mind with a bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me
beyond the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going
through the water at a terrible rate--full before the wind--no reef in
either jib or mainsail--running her bows completely under the foam. It
was a thousand wonders she did not broach to--Augustus having let go
the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much agitated to think of
taking it myself. By good luck, however, she kept steady, and gradually
I recovered some degree of presence of mind. Still the wind was
increasing fearfully, and whenever we rose from a plunge forward, the
sea behind fell combing over our counter, and deluged us with water. I
was so utterly benumbed, too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious
of sensation. At length I summoned up the resolution of despair,
and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been
expected, it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water,
carried away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone
saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now boomed
along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally over the
counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate death. I took the
helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I found that there yet
remained to us a chance of ultimate escape. Augustus still lay senseless
in the bottom of the boat; and as there was imminent danger of his
drowning (the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell), I
contrived to raise him partially up, and keep him in a sitting position,
by passing a rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the
deck of the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could
in my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God, and
made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in
my power.

Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and long
scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons, seemed to
pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat. Never while I
live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I experienced at that
moment. My hair stood erect on my head--I felt the blood congealing
in my veins--my heart ceased utterly to beat, and without having once
raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm, I tumbled headlong and
insensible upon the body of my fallen companion.

I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large whaling-ship (the
Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons were standing over me, and
Augustus, paler than death, was busily occupied in chafing my hands.
Upon seeing me open my eyes, his exclamations of gratitude and joy
excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages
who were present. The mystery of our being in existence was now
soon explained. We had been run down by the whaling-ship, which was
close-hauled, beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture
to set, and consequently running almost at right angles to our own
course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not perceive
our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact--their
shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me. The
huge ship, I was told, rode immediately over us with as much ease as
our own little vessel would have passed over a feather, and without the
least perceptible impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from
the deck of the victim--there was a slight grating sound to be heard
mingling with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was
swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer--but
this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be remembered was
dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless, the captain (Captain
E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for proceeding on his course without
troubling himself further about the matter. Luckily, there were two
of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our
helm, and represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion
ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it was no
business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells; that the ship
should not put about for any such nonsense; and if there was a man run
down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he might drown and be dammed”
 or some language to that effect. Henderson, the first mate, now took the
matter up, being justly indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew,
at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He
spoke plainly, seeing himself upheld by the men, told the captain he
considered him a fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey
his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore.
He strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)
on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm voice,
Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went cleverly
about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it was supposed to
be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be
saved--allowing any to have been on board the boat. Yet, as the reader
has seen, both Augustus and myself were rescued; and our deliverance
seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable
pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the
special interference of Providence.

While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat and
jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke up as having
seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of the vessel (the moon
still shining brightly) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward,
and Henderson, at the same moment, starting up in his seat bawled out
to his crew to back water. He would say nothing else--repeating his cry
impatiently, back water! back water! The men put back as speedily as
possible, but by this time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully
under headway, although all hands on board were making great exertions
to take in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung
to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another huge
lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly
as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious
enough. The body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular
manner to the smooth and shining bottom (the Penguin was coppered and
copper-fastened), and beating violently against it with every movement
of the hull. After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches
of the ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally
disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board--for the body
proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the timber-bolts having
started and broken a passage through the copper, it had arrested my
progress as I passed under the ship, and fastened me in so extraordinary
a manner to her bottom. The head of the bolt had made its way through
the collar of the green baize jacket I had on, and through the back part
of my neck, forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the
right ear. I was immediately put to bed--although life seemed to be
totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain, however,
treated me with every attention--to make amends, I presume, in the eyes
of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the
adventure.

In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship, although
the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not been gone many
minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat, and shortly
afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a
cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest. This induced
the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an
hour, although repeated signals to return were made them by Captain
Block, and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was
fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is
nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could
have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built, however,
for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since had reason to
believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some life-boats used on the
coast of Wales.

After searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned,
it was determined to get back to the ship. They had scarcely made this
resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly
by. They pursued and soon overtook it. It proved to be the entire deck
of the Ariel’s cuddy. Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the
last agonies. Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached
by a rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I
had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt, for
the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so doing,
it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving his life. The
Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down her frame naturally
went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as might have been expected, was
lifted, by the force of the water rushing in, entirely from the
main timbers, and floated (with other fragments, no doubt) to the
surface--Augustus was buoyed up with it, and thus escaped a terrible
death.

It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin before
he could give any account of himself, or be made to comprehend the
nature of the accident which had befallen our boat. At length he became
thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of his sensations while in the water.
Upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness, he found himself
beneath the surface, whirling round and round with inconceivable
rapidity, and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about
his neck. In an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward,
when, his head striking violently against a hard substance, he again
relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in fuller
possession of his reason--this was still, however, in the greatest
degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some accident had
occurred, and that he was in the water, although his mouth was above
the surface, and he could breathe with some freedom. Possibly, at this
period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind, and drawing him
after it, as he floated upon his back. Of course, as long as he could
have retained this position, it would have been nearly impossible that
he should be drowned. Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the
deck, and this post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals
for help. Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been
obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into the sea,
had given himself up for lost. During the whole period of his struggles
he had not the faintest recollection of the Ariel, nor of the matters in
connexion with the source of his disaster. A vague feeling of terror
and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties. When he was
finally picked up, every power of his mind had failed him; and, as
before said, it was nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin
before he became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself--I
was resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and
after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a
half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot oil--a proceeding
suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck, although of an ugly
appearance, proved of little real consequence, and I soon recovered from
its effects.

The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning, after
encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off Nantucket.
Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr. Barnard’s in time for
breakfast--which, luckily, was somewhat late, owing to the party over
night. I suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to
notice our jaded appearance--of course, it would not have borne a very
rigid scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way
of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in Nantucket
had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors
in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty
or forty poor devils, had reference either to the Ariel, my companion,
or myself. We two have since very frequently talked the matter over--but
never without a shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly
confessed to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced
so excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat
he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt himself
sinking beneath its influence.




CHAPTER 2

IN no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce inferences
with entire certainty, even from the most simple data. It might be
supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just related would have
effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea. On the contrary, I
never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident
to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous
deliverance. This short period proved amply long enough to erase from
my memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the pleasurably
exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of the late perilous
accident. My conversations with Augustus grew daily more frequent and
more intensely full of interest. He had a manner of relating his stories
of the ocean (more than one half of which I now suspect to have
been sheer fabrications) well adapted to have weight with one of
my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing
imagination. It is strange, too, that he most strongly enlisted my
feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman, when he depicted his more
terrible moments of suffering and despair. For the bright side of the
painting I had a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and
famine; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime
dragged out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in
an ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires--for they
amounted to desires--are common, I have since been assured, to the whole
numerous race of the melancholy among men--at the time of which I speak
I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a destiny which I felt
myself in a measure bound to fulfil. Augustus thoroughly entered into my
state of mind. It is probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had
resulted in a partial interchange of character.

About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster, the
firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some manner with the
Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were engaged in repairing
and fitting out the brig Grampus for a whaling voyage. She was an old
hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when all was done to her that could be
done. I hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good
vessels belonging to the same owners--but so it was. Mr. Barnard was
appointed to command her, and Augustus was going with him. While the
brig was getting ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of
the opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He found
me by no means an unwilling listener--yet the matter could not be so
easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition; but my mother went
into hysterics at the bare mention of the design; and, more than all,
my grandfather, from whom I expected much, vowed to cut me off with
a shilling if I should ever broach the subject to him again. These
difficulties, however, so far from abating my desire, only added fuel to
the flame. I determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my
intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it
might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any of my
relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself ostensibly
with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had abandoned the design.
I have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with
sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise. The intense hypocrisy
I made use of for the furtherance of my project--an hypocrisy pervading
every word and action of my life for so long a period of time--could
only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning
expectation with which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my
long-cherished visions of travel.

In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged to
leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for the
greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to some
arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At night,
however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes.
After nearly a month passed in this manner, without our hitting upon
any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told me at last that he had
determined upon everything necessary. I had a relation living in New
Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house I was in the habit of spending
occasionally two or three weeks at a time. The brig was to sail about
the middle of June (June, 1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two
before her putting to sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual,
from Mr. Ross, asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert
and Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of
this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed, for New
Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who would contrive
a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This hiding-place, he assured me,
would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many
days, during which I was not to make my appearance. When the brig had
proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out
of question, I should then, he said, be formally installed in all
the comforts of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh
heartily at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter
might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.

The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been matured.
The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday morning I left the
house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed. I went, however, straight
to Augustus, who was waiting for me at the corner of a street. It had
been our original plan that I should keep out of the way until dark, and
then slip on board the brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our
favor, it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the
way to the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a
thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my person
might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the second corner,
after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should appear, standing right in
front of me, and looking me full in the face, but old Mr. Peterson, my
grandfather. “Why, bless my soul, Gordon,” said he, after a long pause,
“why, why,--whose dirty cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied,
assuming, as well as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air
of offended surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable
tones--“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken--my name, in the first place,
bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to know better,
you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty one.” For my life
I could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in
which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke. He started back
two or three steps, turned first pale and then excessively red, threw up
his spectacles, then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with
his umbrella uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if
struck with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled
off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and muttering
between his teeth: “Won’t do--new glasses--thought it was Gordon--d--d
good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”

After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and arrived
at our point of destination in safety. There were only one or two of
the hands on board, and these were busy forward, doing something to the
forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we knew very well, was engaged
at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would remain there until late in the
evening, so we had little to apprehend on his account. Augustus went
first up the vessel’s side, and in a short while I followed him, without
being noticed by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin,
and found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable
style--a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were four
very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths. There was
also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably thick and valuable
carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms. The ceiling
was full seven feet high, and, in short, every thing appeared of a more
roomy and agreeable nature than I had anticipated. Augustus, however,
would allow me but little time for observation, insisting upon the
necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way
into his own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and
next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and bolted it.
I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which I
now found myself. It was about ten feet long, and had only one berth,
which, as I said before, was wide and convenient. In that portion of
the closet nearest the bulkheads there was a space of four feet square,
containing a table, a chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books,
chiefly books of voyages and travels. There were many other little
comforts in the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of
safe or refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of
delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.

He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in
one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know that a portion
of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had been neatly cut out
and again adjusted. As he pressed, this portion rose up at one end
sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath. In this manner
he raised the mouth of the trap (to which the carpet was still fastened
by tacks), and I found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a
small taper by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a
dark lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me follow.
I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by means of a nail
driven into the under side--the carpet, of course, resuming its original
position on the floor of the stateroom, and all traces of the aperture
being concealed.

The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest
difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber
among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my eyes became
accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less trouble, holding
on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought me, at length,
after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an
iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware.
It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. Two
large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a
vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of
the cabin. In every other direction around was wedged as closely as
possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every
species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of
crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less
than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. I
afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this
hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only
one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.

My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be
removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the interior, at
which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one of the cabin berths
covered the whole of its bottom, and it contained almost every article
of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space, allowing
me, at the same time, sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a
sitting position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were
some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full of
water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna sausages, an
enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a dozen bottles of
cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately to take possession of my
little apartment, and this with feelings of higher satisfaction, I am
sure, than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace.
Augustus now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end
of the box, and then, holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a
piece of dark whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my
hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber, to a
nail which was driven into the deck of the hold, immediately beneath the
trap-door leading into his stateroom. By means of this cord I should be
enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance, provided any
unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary. He now took
his departure, leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious
supply of tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as
often as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on the
seventeenth of June.

I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in my
hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice for the
purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just
opposite the opening. During the whole period I saw nothing of Augustus;
but this occasioned me little uneasiness, as I knew the brig was
expected to put to sea every hour, and in the bustle he would not easily
find opportunities of coming down to me. At length I heard the trap
open and shut, and presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was
well, and if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am
as comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be under
weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to let you know,
and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I shall not have a
chance of coming down again for some time--perhaps for three or four
days more. All is going on right aboveboard. After I go up and close the
trap, do you creep along by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in.
You will find my watch there--it may be useful to you, as you have no
daylight to keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have
been buried--only three days--this is the twentieth. I would bring the
watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he went up.

In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in motion,
and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a
voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to make my mind as easy
as possible, and await the course of events until I should be
permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy, although hardly more
comfortable, accommodations of the cabin. My first care was to get the
watch. Leaving the taper burning, I groped along in the dark, following
the cord through windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered
that, after toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or
two of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing the
object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now looked over
the books which had been so thoughtfully provided, and selected the
expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia. With this
I amused myself for some time, when, growing sleepy, I extinguished the
light with great care, and soon fell into a sound slumber.

Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time elapsed
before I could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of
my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered all. Striking a light, I
looked at the watch; but it was run down, and there were, consequently,
no means of determining how long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped,
and I was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates.
Presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the
cold mutton, some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and
found excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a
state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me great
disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I experienced
upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have slept for an
inordinately long period of time. The close atmosphere of the hold might
have had something to do with this, and might, in the end, be productive
of the most serious results. My head ached excessively; I fancied that I
drew every breath with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with
a multitude of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any
disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound up the
watch, contented myself as well as possible.

Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person
came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus of the
grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that the water in
my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was suffering much from
thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna sausages after the loss of my
mutton. I became very uneasy, and could no longer take any interest in
my books. I was overpowered, too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled
at the thought of indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious
influence, like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the
hold. In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in
the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears as if
from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was blowing. I
could not imagine a reason for the absence of Augustus. We were surely
far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up. Some accident
might have happened to him--but I could think of none which would
account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except,
indeed, his having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea
I could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that we
had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near vicinity of
Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to abandon; for such being
the case, the brig must have frequently gone about; and I was entirely
satisfied, from her continual inclination to the larboard, that she had
been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter.
Besides, granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the
island, why should not Augustus have visited me and informed me of
the circumstance? Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of
my solitary and cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another
twenty-four hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way
to the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,
or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a further
supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with this thought,
however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary, into a state
of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My dreams were of the most terrific
description. Every species of calamity and horror befell me. Among other
miseries I was smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of
the most ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their
embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining
eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring
character, spread themselves out before me. Immensely tall trunks of
trees, gray and leafless, rose up in endless succession as far as the
eye could reach. Their roots were concealed in wide-spreading morasses,
whose dreary water lay intensely black, still, and altogether terrible,
beneath. And the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and
waving to and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters
for mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony
and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone, amidst the
burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched a fierce lion
of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me. With
a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and laid bare his horrible
teeth. In another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like
the thunder of the firmament, and I fell impetuously to the earth.
Stifling in a paroxysm of terror, I at last found myself partially
awake. My dream, then, was not all a dream. Now, at least, I was in
possession of my senses. The paws of some huge and real monster were
pressing heavily upon my bosom--his hot breath was in my ear--and his
white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.

Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the utterance
of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken. The beast,
whatever it was, retained his position without attempting any immediate
violence, while I lay in an utterly helpless, and, I fancied, a dying
condition beneath him. I felt that my powers of body and mind were fast
leaving me--in a word, that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer
fright. My brain swam--I grew deadly sick--my vision failed--even the
glaring eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at
length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself to
die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the
animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon my body; but what
was my astonishment, when, with a long and low whine, he commenced
licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness, and with the
most extravagant demonstration of affection and joy! I was bewildered,
utterly lost in amazement--but I could not forget the peculiar whine
of my Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well
knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples--a
giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and reanimation. I rose
hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had been lying, and, throwing
myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend, relieved the
long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears.

As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest
indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress. For a long time
I found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas; but, by very slow
degrees, my thinking faculties returned, and I again called to memory
the several incidents of my condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried
in vain to account; and after busying myself with a thousand different
conjectures respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing
that he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort
by his caresses. Most people love their dogs--but for Tiger I had an
affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly, did
any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had been my
inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances had given
evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value the animal. I
had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of a malignant little
villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with a rope around his neck,
to the water; and the grown dog repaid the obligation, about three years
afterward, by saving me from the bludgeon of a street robber.

Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my ear, that
it had again run down; but at this I was not at all surprised, being
convinced, from the peculiar state of my feelings, that I had slept,
as before, for a very long period of time, how long, it was of course
impossible to say. I was burning up with fever, and my thirst was almost
intolerable. I felt about the box for my little remaining supply of
water, for I had no light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the
lantern, and the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding
the jug, however, I discovered it to be empty--Tiger, no doubt, having
been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of mutton,
the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the box. The
spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I thought of the
water. I was feeble in the extreme--so much so that I shook all over,
as with an ague, at the slightest movement or exertion. To add to my
troubles, the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence, and
the oil-casks which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling
down, so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also,
terrible sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined
me to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate
relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so altogether.
Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for the phosphorus-box
and tapers. The former I found after some little trouble; but, not
discovering the tapers as soon as I had expected (for I remembered very
nearly the spot in which I had placed them), I gave up the search for
the present, and bidding Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey
toward the trap.

In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent.
It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along at all, and
very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me; when, falling
prostrate on my face, I would remain for some minutes in a state
bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled forward by slow degrees,
dreading every moment that I should swoon amid the narrow and intricate
windings of the lumber, in which event I had nothing but death to expect
as the result. At length, upon making a push forward with all the energy
I could command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner
of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few moments;
but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick and violent
roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path, so as
effectually to block up the passage. With my utmost exertions I could
not move it a single inch from its position, it being closely wedged
in among the surrounding boxes and ship-furniture. It became necessary,
therefore, enfeebled as I was, either to leave the guidance of the
whipcord and seek out a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and
resume the path on the other side. The former alternative presented too
many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In my
present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly lose
my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the dismal and
disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded, therefore, without
hesitation, to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude, and
endeavour, as I best might, to clamber over the crate.

Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the undertaking even
a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine. On each side of
the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber, which
the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my
head; or, if this accident did not occur, the path might be effectually
blocked up against my return by the descending mass, as it was in front
by the obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,
upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by every
means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being thus enabled
to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it, it is certain that
my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting
over, and it was better in every respect that I failed. At length, in
a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong
vibration in the side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge
of the planks, and found that a very large one was loose. With my
pocket-knife, which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great
labour, in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,
discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the
opposite side--in other words, that the top was wanting, it being the
bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no important
difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally reached the
nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a gentle touch
pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not rise as soon as I
had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat more determination,
still dreading lest some other person than Augustus might be in his
state-room. The door, however, to my astonishment, remained steady, and
I became somewhat uneasy, for I knew that it had formerly required
but little or no effort to remove it. I pushed it strongly--it was
nevertheless firm: with all my strength--it still did not give way: with
rage, with fury, with despair--it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and
it was evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the
hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or that some
immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was useless to think of
removing.

My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I
attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed. I
could summon up no connected chain of reflection, and, sinking on the
floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most gloomy imaginings, in
which the dreadful deaths of thirst, famine, suffocation, and premature
interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered.
At length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I
arose, and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.
Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted
any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I then forced the
blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met with some hard obstacle.
Scraping against it, I discovered it to be a solid mass of iron, which,
from its peculiar wavy feel as I passed the blade along it, I concluded
to be a chain-cable. The only course now left me was to retrace my
way to the box, and there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to
tranquilize my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape.
I immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after innumerable
difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly exhausted, upon the
mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length by my side, and seemed as
if desirous, by his caresses, of consoling me in my troubles, and urging
me to bear them with fortitude.

The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my
attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he would
suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon reaching out my
hand toward him, I then invariably found him lying on his back, with his
paws uplifted. This conduct, so frequently repeated, appeared strange,
and I could in no manner account for it. As the dog seemed distressed,
I concluded that he had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my
hands, I examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I
then supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he
devoured with avidity--afterward, however, resuming his extraordinary
manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering, like myself, the
torments of thirst, and was about adopting this conclusion as the true
one, when the idea occurred to me that I had as yet only examined his
paws, and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his
body or head. The latter I felt carefully over, but found nothing. On
passing my hand, however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection
of the hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,
I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled the
whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small slip of what
had the feeling of letter paper, through which the string had been
fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left
shoulder of the animal.




CHAPTER 3

THE thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from
Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having happened to
prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had devised this method of
acquainting me with the true state of affairs. Trembling with eagerness,
I now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers.
I had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just
before falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the
trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had deposited
them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind, and busied myself
for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing
articles; never, surely, was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety
and suspense. At length, while groping about, with my head close to the
ballast, near the opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived
a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly
surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared to
be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with this
intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and, before I
could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel along by the box
until I had exactly resumed my original situation. Now, moving my head
with caution to and fro, I found that, by proceeding slowly, with great
care, in an opposite direction to that in which I had at first started,
I was enabled to draw near the light, still keeping it in view.
Presently I came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through
innumerable narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some
fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I
was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell upon two
or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently mumbled by the
dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply
of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of
Augustus. The small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other
rubbish in the barrel, that I despaired of deriving any service from
them, and left them as they were. The phosphorus, of which there was
only a speck or two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned
with it, after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while
remained.

What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark that
I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my face. The
white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not even that when
I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior portions of the retina
toward it--that is to say, by surveying it slightly askance, I found
that it became in some measure perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison
may be imagined, and the note of my friend, if indeed it were a note
from him, seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble, by
disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind.
In vain I revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for
procuring light--such expedients precisely as a man in the perturbed
sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar
purpose--each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the
most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions, just as the
reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker, alternately, one above the
other. At last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational, and which
gave me cause to wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained
it before. I placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and,
collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought
from the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the
palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A clear
light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface; and had
there been any writing upon it, I should not have experienced the
least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it. Not a syllable was there,
however--nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank; the illumination
died away in a few seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.

I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some period
prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on idiocy. There
were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect sanity, and, now and
then, even of energy; but these were few. It must be remembered that
I had been, for many days certainly, inhaling the almost pestilential
atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel, and for a long portion
of that time but scantily supplied with water. For the last fourteen
or fifteen hours I had none--nor had I slept during that time. Salt
provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed,
since the loss of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception
of the sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as
they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched
condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and in
every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact that many
miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the
phosphorus, before the thought suggested itself that I had examined only
one side of the paper. I shall not attempt to describe my feelings
of rage (for I believe I was more angry than any thing else) when the
egregious oversight I had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception.
The blunder itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and
impetuosity rendered it otherwise--in my disappointment at not finding
some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in pieces and thrown
it away, it was impossible to say where.

From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the sagacity of
Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece of the note, I put
it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make him understand that he must
bring me the rest of it. To my astonishment, (for I had taught him none
of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter
at once into my meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon
found another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,
and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for
my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when he
immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he came
back--but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip, which
proved to be all the paper missing--it having been torn, it seems,
only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in finding what few
fragments of the phosphorus were left--being guided by the indistinct
glow one or two of the particles still emitted. My difficulties had
taught me the necessity of caution, and I now took time to reflect upon
what I was about to do. It was very probable, I considered, that some
words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been
examined--but which side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me
no clew in this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there
were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a proper
manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of ascertaining the
point in question beyond a doubt, as the phosphorus remaining would be
altogether insufficient for a third attempt, should I fail in the one I
was now about to make. I placed the paper on a book as before, and sat
for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At
last I thought it barely possible that the written side might have
some unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling might
enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment and passed
my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself.
Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned the paper, adjusting it
on the book. I now again carried my forefinger cautiously along, when
I was aware of an exceedingly slight, but still discernable glow, which
followed as it proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute
remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered the paper
in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then, was that on
which lay the writing, if writing there should finally prove to be.
Again I turned the note, and went to work as I had previously done.
Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a brilliancy ensued as before--but this
time several lines of MS. in a large hand, and apparently in red ink,
became distinctly visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright,
was but momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there
would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three
sentences before me--for I saw there were three. In my anxiety, however,
to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the seven concluding
words, which thus appeared--“blood--your life depends upon lying close.”

Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note--the full
meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey,
that admonition, even although it should have revealed a story of
disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly convinced, have
imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing and yet indefinable
horror with which I was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus
received. And “blood,” too, that word of all words--so rife at all times
with mystery, and suffering, and terror--how trebly full of import did
it now appear--how chilly and heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from
any foregoing words to qualify or render it distinct) did its vague
syllables fall, amid the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost
recesses of my soul!

Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain
concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could
be--but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of
the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the trap, and
before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct
of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all
events by those on board, or, if I could not succeed in this directly,
of trying to cut my way through the orlop deck. The half certainty which
I felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last
emergency, had given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had)
to endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able to
read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and I now, for
the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a paroxysm of despair
I threw myself again upon the mattress, where, for about the period of
a day and night, I lay in a kind of stupor, relieved only by momentary
intervals of reason and recollection.

At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon the
horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours it was
barely possible that I might exist without water--for a longer time I
could not do so. During the first portion of my imprisonment I had made
free use of the cordials with which Augustus had supplied me, but they
only served to excite fever, without in the least degree assuaging
thirst. I had now only about a gill left, and this was of a species of
strong peach liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were
entirely consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the
skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had been eaten
by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my headache was increasing
momentarily, and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me
more or less since my first falling asleep. For some hours past it had
been with the greatest difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each
attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic
action of the chest. But there was still another and very different
source of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had
been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the
mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.

I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the
phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his nose
against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited at
the time to pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward,
it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into
a species of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing
sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was
panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his
eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he
replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed
into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner.
This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour
inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused.
He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully,
although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly
convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the
confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss
what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing him,
yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could distinctly
perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly
animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. At last
I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make
my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition
should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to
pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my
design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by the
altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white
fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of the
ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about
my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left
me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a
movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I do this, than the
dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his
body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left,
while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my
knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected
me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth
pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet,
luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now
beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his
power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from
me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress.
These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had
got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit.
In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of
ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a
single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt
myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be
supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and,
raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed
it furiously upon the floor.

Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my name
pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the direction of
the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the kind, and so intense was
the emotion excited within me by the sound, that I endeavoured in vain
to reply. My powers of speech totally failed, and in an agony of terror
lest my friend should conclude me dead, and return without attempting
to reach me, I stood up between the crates near the door of the box,
trembling convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had
a thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken
it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere
forward of my station. The sound presently grew less distinct, then
again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget my feelings at this
moment? He was going--my friend, my companion, from whom I had a right
to expect so much--he was going--he would abandon me--he was gone! He
would leave me to perish miserably, to expire in the most horrible and
loathesome of dungeons--and one word, one little syllable, would save
me--yet that single syllable I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more
than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled,
and I fell, deadly sick, against the end of the box.

As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of my
pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor. Never did
any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my ears! With the
intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon
Augustus--for I knew that the person who called my name could be no one
but himself. All was silent for some moments. At length I again heard
the word “Arthur!” repeated in a low tone, and one full of hesitation.
Reviving hope loosened at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed
at the top of my voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake
be silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will be
with you immediately--as soon as I can make my way through the hold.”
 For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and every moment
seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon my shoulder, and he
placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water to my lips. Those only who
have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb, or who have known
the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as
those which encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the
unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all
physical luxuries afforded.

When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced from
his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured with the
greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a dark lantern, and
the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and
drink. But I was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence,
and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my
incarceration.




CHAPTER 4

THE brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he had
left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be remembered
that I had then been in the hold for three days; and, during this
period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and so much running
to and fro, especially in the cabin and staterooms, that he had had no
chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap
discovered. When at length he did come, I had assured him that I was
doing as well as possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he
felt but little uneasiness on my account--still, however, watching an
opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that he found
one. Several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let
his father know of the adventure, and have me come up at once; but we
were still within reaching distance of Nantucket, and it was doubtful,
from some expressions which had escaped Captain Barnard, whether he
would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board.
Besides, upon thinking the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could
not imagine that I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate,
in such case, to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he
considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet
with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,
did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch,
and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He then went down
without taking with him any water or provisions, intending in the first
place merely to call my attention, and get me to come from the box to
the trap,--when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down
a supply. When he descended for this purpose he found that I was asleep,
for it seems that I was snoring very loudly. From all the calculations
I can make on the subject, this must have been the slumber into which
I fell just after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,
consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days and
nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both from my own
experience and the assurance of others, to be acquainted with the strong
soporific effects of the stench arising from old fish-oil when closely
confined; and when I think of the condition of the hold in which I was
imprisoned, and the long period during which the brig had been used as a
whaling vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after
once falling asleep, than that I should have slept uninterruptedly for
the period specified above.

Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the
trap--but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and spoke to me in
a louder, and finally in a very loud tone--still I continued to snore.
He was now at a loss what to do. It would take him some time to make his
way through the lumber to my box, and in the meanwhile his absence would
be noticed by Captain Barnard, who had occasion for his services every
minute, in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of
the voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and
await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily induced
to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil
nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone any inconvenience
from my incarceration. He had just made up his mind on these points
when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle, the sound of
which proceeded apparently from the cabin. He sprang through the trap
as quickly as possible, closed it, and threw open the door of his
stateroom. No sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a
pistol flashed in his face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment,
by a blow from a handspike.

A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp upon
his throat; still he was able to see what was going on around him.
His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along the steps of the
companion-way, with his head down, and a deep wound in the forehead,
from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream. He spoke not a
word, and was apparently dying. Over him stood the first mate, eyeing
him with an expression of fiendish derision, and deliberately searching
his pockets, from which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a
chronometer. Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were
rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they soon
equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides Augustus and
Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in the cabin, and these
among the most ruffianly of the brig’s company. The villains now went
upon deck, taking my friend with them after having secured his arms
behind his back. They proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was
fastened down--two of the mutineers standing by it with axes--two also
at the main hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear
there below? tumble up with you, one by one--now, mark that--and no
grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:--at last an
Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping piteously,
and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to spare his life.
The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe. The poor fellow
fell to the deck without a groan, and the black cook lifted him up in
his arms as he would a child, and tossed him deliberately into the sea.
Hearing the blow and the plunge of the body, the men below could now
be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a
proposition was made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued,
and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken.
The mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle
effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.
These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without arms,
submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair words--no
doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for they had no
difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The result proved his
sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy. All in the forecastle
presently signified their intention of submitting, and, ascending one
by one, were pinioned and then thrown on their backs, together with the
first six--there being in all, of the crew who were not concerned in the
mutiny, twenty-seven.

A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen were
dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe, striking each
victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the
other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two perished, and Augustus had
given himself up for lost, expecting every moment his own turn to come
next. But it seemed that the villains were now either weary, or in
some measure disgusted with their bloody labour; for the four remaining
prisoners, together with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with
the rest, were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole
murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until sunset. They
now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors, who lay
not more than four paces off, and could distinguish every word said.
Upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening
effect, for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives
altogether, on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits.
The black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon,
and who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the
mate himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose
repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.
Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily
restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among whom was a
line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters. This man was the
son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of Upsarokas, who live among the
fastnesses of the Black Hills, near the source of the Missouri. His
father was a fur-trader, I believe, or at least connected in some manner
with the Indian trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of
the most ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature,
not more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of
Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick and
broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as legs,
were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to possess no
flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed, being of immense
size, with an indentation on the crown (like that on the head of most
negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal this latter deficiency, which
did not proceed from old age, he usually wore a wig formed of any
hair-like material which presented itself--occasionally the skin of a
Spanish dog or American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a
portion of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural
ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka character. The
mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips were thin, and seemed,
like some other portions of his frame, to be devoid of natural pliancy,
so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any
emotion whatever. This ruling expression may be conceived when it is
considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding, and
never even partially covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this
man with a casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with
laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment,
that if such an expression were indicative of merriment, the merriment
must be that of a demon. Of this singular being many anecdotes were
prevalent among the seafaring men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to
prove his prodigious strength when under excitement, and some of them
had given rise to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it
seems, he was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of
derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in speaking
of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he proved the main
instrument in preserving the life of Augustus, and because I shall
have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my
narrative--a narrative, let me here say, which, in its latter portions,
will be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the
range of human experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits
of human credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining
credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in time
and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most
improbable of my statements.

After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was
determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of
Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping as his
clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest whaleboats. The
mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain Barnard was still
living--for, it will be remembered, he was left below when the mutineers
came up. Presently the two made their appearance, the captain pale as
death, but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound. He spoke
to the men in a voice hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him
adrift, but to return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever
they chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He might
as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians seized him by the
arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into the boat, which had been
lowered while the mate went below. The four men who were lying on the
deck were then untied and ordered to follow, which they did without
attempting any resistance--Augustus being still left in his painful
position, although he struggled and prayed only for the poor
satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of
sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither mast,
sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few minutes,
during which the mutineers held another consultation--it was then
finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on--there were neither
moon nor stars visible--and a short and ugly sea was running, although
there was no great deal of wind. The boat was instantly out of sight,
and little hope could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who
were in it. This event happened, however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’
north, longitude 61 degrees 20’ west, and consequently at no very great
distance from the Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to
console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in
reaching the land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by
vessels off the coast.

All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her original
course to the southwest--the mutineers being bent upon some piratical
expedition, in which, from all that could be understood, a ship was to
be intercepted on her way from the Cape Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No
attention was paid to Augustus, who was untied and suffered to go about
anywhere forward of the cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him
with some degree of kindness, and on one occasion saved him from
the brutality of the cook. His situation was still one of the most
precarious, as the men were continually intoxicated, and there was no
relying upon their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to
himself. His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most
distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never reason to
doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once he had resolved
to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board, but was
restrained from so doing, partly through recollection of the atrocities
he had already beheld, and partly through a hope of being able soon to
bring me relief. For the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch;
but, in spite of the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after
the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the
night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the eastward,
and all hands were called up to take in sail. During the confusion which
ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and into the stateroom.
What was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had
been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of sea-stores and
ship-furniture, and that several fathoms of old chain-cable, which had
been stowed away beneath the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence
to make room for a chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap!
To remove it without discovery was impossible, and he returned on
deck as quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the
throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was about
flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was again
preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus was now put
in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on board), and his feet
lashed tightly together. He was then taken into the steerage, and thrown
into a lower berth next to the forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance
that he should never put his foot on deck again “until the brig was no
longer a brig.” This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into
the berth--it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by
the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate means of my
relief, as will presently appear.




CHAPTER 5

FOR some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus
abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth alive.
He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of the men who
should come down with my situation, thinking it better to let me take my
chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold,--for it had
been ten days since I was first imprisoned, and my jug of water was not
a plentiful supply even for four. As he was thinking on this subject,
the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible
to communicate with me by the way of the main hold. In any other
circumstances, the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have
prevented him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little
prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his whole
mind, therefore, upon the task.

His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no method
of removing them, and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very
outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could
be slipped off and on at pleasure, with very little effort or
inconvenience, merely by squeezing his hands through them,--this species
of manacle being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons,
in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his
feet, and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily
be readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to
examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition here was
of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he should have
little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice was now heard at the
forecastle companion-way, and he had just time to put his right hand
into its handcuff (the left had not been removed) and to draw the rope
in a slipknot around his ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by
Tiger, who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had
been brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the animal,
and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the
voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately after first taking
me into the hold, but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon
his bringing the watch. Since the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him
before his appearance with Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost,
supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant
villains belonging to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had
crawled into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to
turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let him out,
and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to
appreciate, had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion,
leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes, with a can of
water, he then went on deck, promising to come down with something more
to eat on the next day.

When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and
unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress on
which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the ruffians had
not thought it worth while to search him) commenced cutting vigorously
across one of the partition planks, as closely as possible to the floor
of the berth. He chose to cut here, because, if suddenly interrupted, he
would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the
mattress fall into its proper position. For the remainder of the day,
however, no disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided
the plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the
forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the cabin since
the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the sea-stores of Captain
Barnard, and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the
navigation of the brig. These circumstances proved fortunate both for
myself and Augustus; for, had matters been otherwise, he would have
found it impossible to reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence
in his design. It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the
second division of the board (which was about a foot above the first
cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage
through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got here, he made
his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch, although in so
doing he had to scramble over tiers of oil-casks piled nearly as high as
the upper deck, there being barely room enough left for his body. Upon
reaching the hatch he found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing
between two rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt
getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing
through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore resolved to
return, and wait till the next night. With this design, he proceeded to
loosen the hatch, so that he might have as little detention as possible
when he should come again. No sooner had he loosened it than Tiger
sprang eagerly to the small opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and
then uttered a long whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious
to remove the covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from
his behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and Augustus
thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him
down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the note, as it was
especially desirable that I should make no attempt at forcing my way out
at least under existing circumstances, and there could be no certainty
of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events
proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did;
for, had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly
have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the crew, and
both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence.

Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the
materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a pen; and
this by means of feeling altogether, for the between-decks was as
dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter--a
duplicate of the forged letter from Mr. Ross. This had been the original
draught; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated,
Augustus had written another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into
his coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink alone
was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found for this by
means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the back of a finger
just above the nail--a copious flow of blood ensuing, as usual, from
wounds in that vicinity. The note was now written, as well as it could
be in the dark and under the circumstances. It briefly explained that a
mutiny had taken place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I
might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but
must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with these
words: “_I have scrawled this with blood--your life depends upon lying
close._”

This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down the
hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the forecastle,
where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in
his absence. To conceal the hole in the partition, he drove his knife in
just above it, and hung up a pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His
handcuffs were then replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.

These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came below,
very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him my friend’s
allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of a dozen large
Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He sat for some time on
a chest by the berth, and talked freely about the mate and the general
concerns of the brig. His demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and
even grotesque. At one time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct.
At last, however, he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his
prisoner a good dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew
(harpooners) came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the
last stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of talking
unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they were much divided
among themselves as to their ultimate course, agreeing in no point,
except the attack on the ship from the Cape Verd Islands, with
which they were in hourly expectation of meeting. As far as could be
ascertained, the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the
sake of booty; a private pique of the chief mate’s against Captain
Barnard having been the main instigation. There now seemed to be two
principal factions among the crew--one headed by the mate, the other by
the cook. The former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel
which should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India
Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however, which was
the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its partisans, were bent
upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the South
Pacific; there either to take whale, or act otherwise, as circumstances
should suggest. The representations of Peters, who had frequently
visited these regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,
wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit and
pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found
among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the perfect security
and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed, but, more particularly, on
the deliciousness of the climate, on the abundant means of good living,
and on the voluptuous beauty of the women. As yet, nothing had been
absolutely determined upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager
were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and
there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried
into effect.

The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered the
forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He then freed
himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his attempt. A bottle
was found in one of the berths, and this he filled with water from the
pitcher left by Peters, storing his pockets at the same time with cold
potatoes. To his great joy he also came across a lantern, with a small
piece of tallow candle in it. This he could light at any moment, as he
had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite
dark, he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the
precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey the
idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the pea-jacket
on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture--this manoeuvre being
easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece of plank taken out
until afterward. He was now on the main orlop deck, and proceeded to
make his way, as before, between the upper deck and the oil-casks to
the main hatchway. Having reached this, he lit the piece of candle, and
descended, groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of
the hold. In a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench
and the closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible
that I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so
oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him no
reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The brig was
rolling violently, and there was so much noise in consequence, that it
was useless to listen for any weak sound, such as those of my breathing
or snoring. He threw open the lantern, and held it as high as possible,
whenever an opportunity occurred, in order that, by observing the light,
I might, if alive, be aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing
was heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume the
character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force a passage,
if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth
of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of
anxiety, until, at length, he found the pathway utterly blocked up, and
that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course
in which he had set out. Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself
among the lumber in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this
period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had
thrown down. Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred--for,
upon this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny
depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this fact.
A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented
Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and
unreserved communion afterward induced him to reveal. Upon finding his
further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not
overcome, he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me, and
return at once to the forecastle. Before condemning him entirely on this
head, the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken
into consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence
from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would necessarily be
so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak. His candle
was expiring in the socket, and there would be the greatest difficulty
in retracing his way to the hatchway in the dark. It must be allowed,
too, that he had every good reason to believe me dead; in which event
no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box, and a world of
danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly
called, and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and
nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had
left with me--a supply which it was not at all probable I had hoarded in
the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause to expect a speedy
release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must have appeared to him,
coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage, of a nature
absolutely poisonous, and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to
me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box--the hatchways at that
time having been constantly open for many months previous. Add to these
considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately
witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and narrow escapes
from death, together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he
still existed--circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every
energy of mind--and the reader will be easily brought, as I have been,
to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in faith with
sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger.

The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was not sure
that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was sufficient
inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the orlop deck by
means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull in the pitchings of
the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command,
regardless, for the moment, of being overheard by the crew. It will
be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me, but I was
so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply.
Confident, now, that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he
descended, with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss
of time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise
occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made
considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again
caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately, and,
clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name, loudly as
before, having watched for a lull. This time I found voice to answer.
Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive, he now resolved to brave
every difficulty and danger in reaching me. Having extricated himself as
quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed
in, he at length struck into an opening which promised better, and
finally, after a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of
utter exhaustion.
