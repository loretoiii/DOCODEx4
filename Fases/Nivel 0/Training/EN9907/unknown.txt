She loved him so, that when he went away to a little war in which his
country was interested she could not understand, nor quite forgive.

As the correspondent of a newspaper, Chesterton had looked on at other
wars; when the yellow races met, when the infidel Turk spanked the
Christian Greek; and one he had watched from inside a British square,
where he was greatly alarmed lest he should be trampled upon by
terrified camels. This had happened before he and she had met. After
they met, she told him that what chances he had chosen to take before
he came into her life fell outside of her jurisdiction. But now that
his life belonged to her, this talk of his standing up to be shot at was
wicked. It was worse than wicked; it was absurd.

When the Maine sank in Havana harbor and the word “war” was appearing
hourly in hysterical extras, Miss Armitage explained her position.

“You mustn’t think,” she said, “that I am one of those silly girls who
would beg you not to go to war.”

At the moment of speaking her cheek happened to be resting against his,
and his arm was about her, so he humbly bent his head and kissed her,
and whispered very proudly and softly, “No, dearest.”

At which she withdrew from him frowning.

“No! I’m not a bit like those girls,” she proclaimed. “I merely tell you
YOU CAN’T GO! My gracious!” she cried, helplessly. She knew the words
fell short of expressing her distress, but her education had not
supplied her with exclamations of greater violence.

“My goodness!” she cried. “How can you frighten me so? It’s not like
you,” she reproached him. “You are so unselfish, so noble. You are
always thinking of other people. How can you talk of going to war--to be
killed--to me? And now, now that you have made me love you so?”

The hands, that when she talked seemed to him like swallows darting
and flashing in the sunlight, clutched his sleeve. The fingers, that
he would rather kiss than the lips of any other woman that ever lived,
clung to his arm. Their clasp reminded him of that of a drowning child
he had once lifted from the surf.

“If you should die,” whispered Miss Armitage. “What would I do. What
would I do!”

“But my dearest,” cried the young man. “My dearest ONE! I’ve GOT to go.
It’s our own war. Everybody else will go,” he pleaded. “Every man you
know, and they’re going to fight, too. I’m going only to look on. That’s
bad enough, isn’t it, without sitting at home? You should be sorry I’m
not going to fight.”

“Sorry!” exclaimed the girl. “If you love me--”

“If I love you,” shouted the young man. His voice suggested that he was
about to shake her. “How dare you?”

She abandoned that position and attacked from one more logical.

“But why punish me?” she protested. “Do I want the war? Do I want to
free Cuba? No! I want YOU, and if you go, you are the one who is sure
to be killed. You are so big--and so brave, and you will be rushing in
wherever the fighting is, and then--then you will die.” She raised
her eyes and looked at him as though seeing him from a great distance.
“And,” she added fatefully, “I will die, too, or maybe I will have to
live, to live without you for years, for many miserable years.”

Fearfully, with great caution, as though in his joy in her he might
crush her in his hands, the young man drew her to him and held her
close. After a silence he whispered. “But, you know that nothing can
happen to me. Not now, that God has let me love you. He could not be so
cruel. He would not have given me such happiness to take it from me. A
man who loves you, as I love you, cannot come to any harm. And the man
YOU love is immortal, immune. He holds a charmed life. So long as you
love him, he must live.”

The eyes of the girl smiled up at him through her tears. She lifted her
lips to his. “Then you will never die!” she said.

She held him away from her. “Listen!” she whispered. “What you say is
true. It must be true, because you are always right. I love you so that
nothing can harm you. My love will be a charm. It will hang around your
neck and protect you, and keep you, and bring you back to me. When you
are in danger my love will save you. For, while it lives, I live. When
it dies--”

Chesterton kissed her quickly.

“What happens then,” he said, “doesn’t matter.”

The war game had run its happy-go-lucky course briefly and brilliantly,
with “glory enough for all,” even for Chesterton. For, in no previous
campaign had good fortune so persistently stood smiling at his elbow. At
each moment of the war that was critical, picturesque, dramatic, by some
lucky accident he found himself among those present. He could not lose.
Even when his press boat broke down at Cardenas, a Yankee cruiser and
two Spanish gun-boats, apparently for his sole benefit, engaged in an
impromptu duel within range of his megaphone. When his horse went lame,
the column with which he had wished to advance, passed forward to the
front unmolested, while the rear guard, to which he had been forced to
join his fortune, fought its way through the stifling underbrush.

Between his news despatches, when he was not singing the praises of
his fellow-countrymen, or copying lists of their killed and wounded, he
wrote to Miss Armitage. His letters were scrawled on yellow copy
paper and consisted of repetitions of the three words, “I love you,”
 rearranged, illuminated, and intensified.

Each letter began much in the same way. “The war is still going on. You
can read about it in the papers. What I want you to know is that I love
you as no man ever--” And so on for many pages.

From her only one of the letters she wrote reached him. It was picked up
in the sand at Siboney after the medical corps, in an effort to wipe out
the yellow-fever, had set fire to the post-office tent.

She had written it some weeks before from her summer home at Newport,
and in it she said: “When you went to the front, I thought no woman
could love more than I did then. But, now I know. At least I know one
girl who can. She cannot write it. She can never tell you. You must just
believe.

“Each day I hear from you, for as soon as the paper comes, I take it
down to the rocks and read your cables, and I look south across the
ocean to Cuba, and try to see you in all that fighting and heat and
fever. But I am not afraid. For each morning I wake to find I love you
more; that it has grown stronger, more wonderful, more hard to bear.
And I know the charm I gave you grows with it, and is more powerful,
and that it will bring you back to me wearing new honors, ‘bearing your
sheaves with you.’

“As though I cared for your new honors. I want YOU, YOU, YOU--only YOU.”

When Santiago surrendered and the invading army settled down to arrange
terms of peace, and imbibe fever, and General Miles moved to Porto Rico,
Chesterton moved with him.

In that pretty little island a command of regulars under a general of
the regular army had, in a night attack, driven back the Spaniards from
Adhuntas. The next afternoon as the column was in line of march, and the
men were shaking themselves into their accoutrements, a dusty, sweating
volunteer staff officer rode down the main street of Adhuntas, and with
the authority of a field marshal, held up his hand.

“General Miles’s compliments, sir,” he panted, “and peace is declared!”

Different men received the news each in a different fashion. Some
whirled their hats in the air and cheered. Those who saw promotion and
the new insignia on their straps vanish, swore deeply. Chesterton fell
upon his saddle-bags and began to distribute his possessions among
the enlisted men. After he had remobilized, his effects consisted of a
change of clothes, his camera, water-bottle, and his medicine case. In
his present state of health and spirits he could not believe he stood
in need of the medicine case, but it was a gift from Miss Armitage, and
carried with it a promise from him that he always would carry it. He
had “packed” it throughout the campaign, and for others it had proved of
value.

“I take it you are leaving us,” said an officer enviously.

“I am leaving you so quick,” cried Chesterton laughing, “that you won’t
even see the dust. There’s a transport starts from Mayaguez at six
to-morrow morning, and, if I don’t catch it, this pony will die on the
wharf.”

“The road to Mayaguez is not healthy for Americans,” said the general in
command. “I don’t think I ought to let you go. The enemy does not know
peace is on yet, and there are a lot of guerillas--”

Chesterton shook his head in pitying wonder.

“Not let me go!” he exclaimed. “Why, General, you haven’t enough men in
your command to stop me, and as for the Spaniards and guerillas--! I’m
homesick,” cried the young man. “I’m so damned homesick that I am liable
to die of it before the transport gets me to Sandy Hook.”

“If you are shot up by an outpost,” growled the general, “you will be
worse off than homesick. It’s forty miles to Mayaguez. Better wait till
daylight. Where’s the sense of dying, after the fighting’s over?”

“If I don’t catch that transport I sure WILL die,” laughed Chesterton.
His head was bent and he was tugging at his saddle girths. Apparently
the effort brought a deeper shadow to his tan, “but nothing else can
kill me! I have a charm, General,” he exclaimed.

“We hadn’t noticed it,” said the general.

The staff officers, according to regulations, laughed.

“It’s not that kind of a charm,” said Chesterton. “Good-by, General.”

The road was hardly more than a trail, but the moon made it as light
as day, and cast across it black tracings of the swinging vines and
creepers; while high in the air it turned the polished surface of the
palms into glittering silver. As he plunged into the cool depths of the
forest Chesterton threw up his arms and thanked God that he was moving
toward her. The luck that had accompanied him throughout the campaign
had held until the end. Had he been forced to wait for a transport, each
hour would have meant a month of torment, an arid, wasted place in his
life. As it was, with each eager stride of El Capitan, his little Porto
Rican pony, he was brought closer to her. He was so happy that as
he galloped through the dark shadows of the jungle or out into the
brilliant moonlight he shouted aloud and sang; and again as he urged El
Capitan to greater bursts of speed, he explained in joyous, breathless
phrases why it was that he urged him on.

“For she is wonderful and most beautiful,” he cried, “the most glorious
girl in all the world! And, if I kept her waiting, even for a moment, El
Capitan, I would be unworthy--and I might lose her! So you see we ride
for a great prize!”

The Spanish column that, the night before, had been driven from
Adhuntas, now in ignorance of peace, occupied both sides of the valley
through which ran the road to Mayaguez, and in ambush by the road itself
had placed an outpost of two men. One was a sharp-shooter of the picked
corps of the Guardia Civile, and one a sergeant of the regiment that lay
hidden in the heights. If the Americans advanced toward Mayaguez, these
men were to wait until the head of the column drew abreast of them, when
they were to fire. The report of their rifles would be the signal for
those in the hill above to wipe out the memory of Adhuntas.
