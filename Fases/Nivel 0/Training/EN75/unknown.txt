CHAPTER 1

The Great Whirlpool


"Seems to me," said Cap'n Bill, as he sat beside Trot under the big
acacia tree, looking out over the blue ocean, "seems to me, Trot, as how
the more we know, the more we find we don't know."

"I can't quite make that out, Cap'n Bill," answered the little girl in a
serious voice, after a moment's thought, during which her eyes followed
those of the old sailor-man across the glassy surface of the sea. "Seems
to me that all we learn is jus' so much gained."

"I know; it looks that way at first sight," said the sailor, nodding his
head; "but those as knows the least have a habit of thinkin' they know
all there is to know, while them as knows the most admits what a turr'ble
big world this is. It's the knowing ones that realize one lifetime ain't
long enough to git more'n a few dips o' the oars of knowledge."

Trot didn't answer. She was a very little girl, with big, solemn eyes and
an earnest, simple manner. Cap'n Bill had been her faithful companion for
years and had taught her almost everything she knew.

He was a wonderful man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his
hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as
an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out
in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color,
and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was
missing, from the knee down, and that was why the sailor no longer sailed
the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on
land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean, but when
it came to "runnin' up aloft" or performing active duties on shipboard,
the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss of his leg had ruined
his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the
education and companionship of the little girl.

[Illustration: The old sailor devoted himself to the Education of the
little girl.]

The accident to Cap'n Bill's leg had happened at about the time Trot was
born, and ever since that he had lived with Trot's mother as "a star
boarder," having enough money saved up to pay for his weekly "keep." He
loved the baby and often held her on his lap; her first ride was on Cap'n
Bill's shoulders, for she had no baby-carriage; and when she began to
toddle around, the child and the sailor became close comrades and enjoyed
many strange adventures together. It is said the fairies had been present
at Trot's birth and had marked her forehead with their invisible mystic
signs, so that she was able to see and do many wonderful things.

The acacia tree was on top of a high bluff, but a path ran down the bank
in a zigzag way to the water's edge, where Cap'n Bill's boat was moored
to a rock by means of a stout cable. It had been a hot, sultry afternoon,
with scarcely a breath of air stirring, so Cap'n Bill and Trot had been
quietly sitting beneath the shade of the tree, waiting for the sun to get
low enough for them to take a row.

They had decided to visit one of the great caves which the waves had
washed out of the rocky coast during many years of steady effort. The
caves were a source of continual delight to both the girl and the
sailor, who loved to explore their awesome depths.

"I b'lieve, Cap'n," remarked Trot, at last, "that it's time for us to
start."

The old man cast a shrewd glance at the sky, the sea and the motionless
boat. Then he shook his head.

"Mebbe it's time, Trot," he answered, "but I don't jes' like the looks o'
things this afternoon."

"What's wrong?" she asked wonderingly.

"Can't say as to that. Things is too quiet to suit me, that's all. No
breeze, not a ripple a-top the water, nary a gull a-flyin' anywhere, an'
the end o' the hottest day o' the year. I ain't no weather-prophet, Trot,
but any sailor would know the signs is ominous."

"There's nothing wrong that I can see," said Trot. "If there was a cloud
in the sky even as big as my thumb, we might worry about it; but--look,
Cap'n!--the sky is as clear as can be."

He looked again and nodded.

"P'r'aps we can make the cave, all right," he agreed, not wishing to
disappoint her. "It's only a little way out, an' we'll be on the watch;
so come along, Trot."

Together they descended the winding path to the beach. It was no trouble
for the girl to keep her footing on the steep way, but Cap'n Bill,
because of his wooden leg, had to hold on to rocks and roots now and
then to save himself from tumbling. On a level path he was as spry as
anyone, but to climb up hill or down required some care.

They reached the boat safely and while Trot was untying the rope Cap'n
Bill reached into a crevice of the rock and drew out several tallow
candles and a box of wax matches, which he thrust into the capacious
pockets of his "sou'wester." This sou'wester was a short coat of oilskin
which the old sailor wore on all occasions--when he wore a coat at
all--and the pockets always contained a variety of objects, useful and
ornamental, which made even Trot wonder where they all came from and why
Cap'n Bill should treasure them. The jackknives--a big one and a little
one--the bits of cord, the fishhooks, the nails: these were handy to
have on certain occasions. But bits of shell, and tin boxes with unknown
contents, buttons, pincers, bottles of curious stones and the like,
seemed quite unnecessary to carry around. That was Cap'n Bill's business,
however, and now that he added the candles and the matches to his
collection Trot made no comment, for she knew these last were to light
their way through the caves.

The sailor always rowed the boat, for he handled the oars with strength
and skill. Trot sat in the stern and steered. The place where they
embarked was a little bight or circular bay, and the boat cut across a
much larger bay toward a distant headland where the caves were located,
right at the water's edge. They were nearly a mile from shore and about
half-way across the bay when Trot suddenly sat up straight and exclaimed:
"What's that, Cap'n?"

He stopped rowing and turned half around to look.

[Illustration]

"That, Trot," he slowly replied, "looks to me mighty like a whirlpool."

"What makes it, Cap'n?"

"A whirl in the air makes the whirl in the water. I was afraid as we'd
meet with trouble, Trot. Things didn't look right. The air was too still."

"It's coming closer," said the girl.

The old man grabbed the oars and began rowing with all his strength.

"'Tain't comin' closer to us, Trot," he gasped; "it's we that are comin'
closer to the whirlpool. The thing is drawin' us to it like a magnet!"

Trot's sun-bronzed face was a little paler as she grasped the tiller
firmly and tried to steer the boat away; but she said not a word to
indicate fear.

The swirl of the water as they came nearer made a roaring sound that
was fearful to listen to. So fierce and powerful was the whirlpool that
it drew the surface of the sea into the form of a great basin, slanting
downward toward the center, where a big hole had been made in the
ocean--a hole with walls of water that were kept in place by the rapid
whirling of the air.

The boat in which Trot and Cap'n Bill were riding was just on the outer
edge of this saucer-like slant, and the old sailor knew very well that
unless he could quickly force the little craft away from the rushing
current they would soon be drawn into the great black hole that yawned in
the middle. So he exerted all his might and pulled as he had never pulled
before. He pulled so hard that the left oar snapped in two and sent Cap'n
Bill sprawling upon the bottom of the boat.

He scrambled up quickly enough and glanced over the side. Then he looked
at Trot, who sat quite still, with a serious, far-away look in her sweet
eyes. The boat was now speeding swiftly of its own accord, following
the line of the circular basin round and round and gradually drawing
nearer to the great hole in the center. Any further effort to escape the
whirlpool was useless, and realizing this fact Cap'n Bill turned toward
Trot and put an arm around her, as if to shield her from the awful fate
before them. He did not try to speak, because the roar of the waters
would have drowned the sound of his voice.

These two faithful comrades had faced dangers before, but nothing to
equal that which now faced them. Yet Cap'n Bill, noting the look in
Trot's eyes and remembering how often she had been protected by unseen
powers, did not quite give way to despair.

The great hole in the dark water--now growing nearer and nearer--looked
very terrifying; but they were both brave enough to face it and await the
result of the adventure.




[Illustration]


CHAPTER 2

The Cavern Under the Sea


The circles were so much smaller at the bottom of the basin, and the boat
moved so much more swiftly, that Trot was beginning to get dizzy with
the motion, when suddenly the boat made a leap and dived headlong into
the murky depths of the hole. Whirling like tops, but still clinging
together, the sailor and the girl were separated from their boat and
plunged down--down--down--into the farthermost recesses of the great
ocean.

At first their fall was swift as an arrow, but presently they seemed to
be going more moderately and Trot was almost sure that unseen arms were
about her, supporting her and protecting her. She could see nothing,
because the water filled her eyes and blurred her vision, but she clung
fast to Cap'n Bill's sou'wester, while other arms clung fast to her, and
so they gradually sank down and down until a full stop was made, when
they began to ascend again.

But it seemed to Trot that they were not rising straight to the surface
from where they had come. The water was no longer whirling them and they
seemed to be drawn in a slanting direction through still, cool ocean
depths. And then--in much quicker time than I have told it--up they
popped to the surface and were cast at full length upon a sandy beach,
where they lay choking and gasping for breath and wondering what had
happened to them.

Trot was the first to recover. Disengaging herself from Cap'n Bill's
wet embrace and sitting up, she rubbed the water from her eyes and
then looked around her. A soft, bluish-green glow lighted the place,
which seemed to be a sort of cavern, for above and on either side of
her were rugged rocks. They had been cast upon a beach of clear sand,
which slanted upward from the pool of water at their feet--a pool which
doubtless led into the big ocean that fed it. Above the reach of the
waves of the pool were more rocks, and still more and more, into the dim
windings and recesses of which the glowing light from the water did not
penetrate.

The place looked grim and lonely, but Trot was thankful that she was
still alive and had suffered no severe injury during her trying adventure
under water. At her side Cap'n Bill was sputtering and coughing, trying
to get rid of the water he had swallowed. Both of them were soaked
through, yet the cavern was warm and comfortable and a wetting did not
dismay the little girl in the least.

She crawled up the slant of sand and gathered in her hand a bunch of
dried seaweed, with which she mopped the face of Cap'n Bill and cleared
the water from his eyes and ears. Presently the old man sat up and stared
at her intently. Then he nodded his bald head three times and said in a
gurgling voice:

"Mighty good, Trot; mighty good! We didn't reach Davy Jones's locker that
time, did we? Though why we didn't, an' why we're here, is more'n I kin
make out."

"Take it easy, Cap'n," she replied. "We're safe enough, I guess, at least
for the time being."

He squeezed the water out of the bottoms of his loose trousers and felt
of his wooden leg and arms and head, and finding he had brought all
of his person with him he gathered courage to examine closely their
surroundings.

"Where d'ye think we are, Trot?" he presently asked.

"Can't say, Cap'n. P'r'aps in one of our caves."

He shook his head. "No," said he, "I don't think that, at all. The
distance we came up didn't seem half as far as the distance we went
down; an' you'll notice there ain't any outside entrance to this cavern
whatever. It's a reg'lar dome over this pool o' water, and unless there's
some passage at the back, up yonder, we're fast pris'ners."

Trot looked thoughtfully over her shoulder.

"When we're rested," she said, "we will crawl up there and see if there's
a way to get out."

Cap'n Bill reached in the pocket of his oilskin coat and took out his
pipe. It was still dry, for he kept it in an oilskin pouch with his
tobacco. His matches were in a tight tin box, so in a few moments the old
sailor was smoking contentedly. Trot knew it helped him to think when
he was in any difficulty. Also, the pipe did much to restore the old
sailor's composure, after his long ducking and his terrible fright--a
fright that was more on Trot's account than his own.

The sand was dry where they sat, and soaked up the water that dripped
from their clothing. When Trot had squeezed the wet out of her hair she
began to feel much like her old self again. By and by they got upon their
feet and crept up the incline to the scattered boulders above. Some of
these were of huge size, but by passing between some and around others,
they were able to reach the extreme rear of the cavern.

"Yes," said Trot, with interest, "here's a round hole."

"And it's black as night inside it," remarked Cap'n Bill.

"Just the same," answered the girl, "we ought to explore it, and see
where it goes, 'cause it's the only poss'ble way we can get out of this
place."

Cap'n Bill eyed the hole doubtfully.

"It may be a way out o' here, Trot," he said, "but it may be a way into
a far worse place than this. I'm not sure but our best plan is to stay
right here."

Trot wasn't sure, either, when she thought of it in that light.. After
awhile she made her way back to the sands again, and Cap'n Bill followed
her. As they sat down, the child looked thoughtfully at the sailor's
bulging pockets.

[Illustration: Trot]

"How much food have we got, Cap'n?" she asked.

"Half a dozen ship's biscuits an' a hunk o' cheese," he replied. "Want
some now, Trot?"

She shook her head, saying:

"That ought to keep us alive 'bout three days if we're careful of it."

"Longer'n that, Trot," said Cap'n Bill, but his voice was a little
troubled and unsteady.

"But if we stay here we're bound to starve in time," continued the girl,
"while if we go into the dark hole--"

"Some things are more hard to face than starvation," said the sailor-man,
gravely. "We don't know what's inside that dark hole. Trot, nor where it
might lead us to."

"There's a way to find that out," she persisted.

Instead of replying, Cap'n Bill began searching in his pockets. He soon
drew out a little package of fishhooks and a long line. Trot watched him
join them together. Then he crept a little way up the slope and turned
over a big rock. Two or three small crabs began scurrying away over the
sands and the old sailor caught them and put one on his hook and the
others in his pocket. Coming back to the pool he swung the hook over
his shoulder and circled it around his head and cast it nearly into
the center of the water, where he allowed it to sink gradually, paying
out the line as far as it would go. When the end was reached, he began
drawing it in again, until the crab bait was floating on the surface.

Trot watched him cast the line a second time, and a third. She decided
that either there were no fishes in the pool or they would not bite
the crab bait. But Cap'n Bill was an old fisherman and not easily
discouraged. When the crab got away he put another on the hook. When the
crabs were all gone he climbed up the rocks and found some more.

Meantime Trot tired of watching him and lay down upon the sands, where
she fell fast asleep. During the next two hours her clothing dried
completely, as did that of the old sailor. They were both so used to salt
water that there was no danger of taking cold.

Finally the little girl was wakened by a splash beside her and a grunt of
satisfaction from Cap'n Bill. She opened her eyes to find that the Cap'n
had landed a silver-scaled fish weighing about two pounds. This cheered
her considerably and she hurried to scrape together a heap of seaweed,
while Cap'n Bill cut up the fish with his jackknife and got it ready for
cooking.

They had cooked fish with seaweed before. Cap'n Bill wrapped his fish
in some of the weed and dipped it in the water to dampen it. Then he
lighted a match and set fire to Trot's heap, which speedily burned down
to a glowing bed of ashes. Then they laid the wrapped fish on the ashes,
covered it with more seaweed, and allowed this to catch fire and burn to
embers. After feeding the fire with seaweed for some time, the sailor
finally decided that their supper was ready, so he scattered the ashes
and drew out the bits of fish, still encased in their smoking wrappings.
When these wrappings were removed, the fish was found thoroughly cooked
and both Trot and Cap'n Bill ate of it freely. It had a slight flavor of
seaweed and would have been better with a sprinkling of salt.

The soft glow which until now had lighted the cavern, began to grow dim,
but there was a great quantity of seaweed in the place, so after they
had eaten their fish they kept the fire alive for a time by giving it a
handful of fuel now and then.

From an inner pocket the sailor drew a small flask of battered metal and
unscrewing the cap handed it to Trot. She took but one swallow of the
water, although she wanted more, and she noticed that Cap'n Bill merely
wet his lips with it.

"S'pose," said she, staring at the glowing seaweed fire and speaking
slowly, "that we can catch all the fish we need; how 'bout the
drinking-water, Cap'n?"

He moved uneasily but did not reply. Both of them were thinking about the
dark hole, but while Trot had little fear of it the old man could not
overcome his dislike to enter the place. He knew that Trot was right,
though. To remain in the cavern, where they now were, could only result
in slow but sure death.

It was nighttime upon the earth's surface, so the little girl became
drowsy and soon fell asleep. After a time the old sailor slumbered on the
sands beside her. It was very still and nothing disturbed them for hours.
When at last they awoke the cavern was light again.

They had divided one of the biscuits and were munching it for breakfast
when they were startled by a sudden splash in the pool. Looking toward
it they saw emerging from the water the most curious creature either of
them had ever beheld. It wasn't a fish, Trot decided, nor was it a beast.
It had wings, though, and queer wings they were: shaped like an inverted
chopping-bowl and covered with tough skin instead of feathers. It had
four legs--much like the legs of a stork, only double the number--and
its head was shaped a good deal like that of a poll parrot, with a beak
that curved downward in front and upward at the edges, and was half bill
and half mouth. But to call it a bird was out of the question, because
it had 110 feathers whatever except a crest of wavy plumes of a scarlet
color on the very top of its head. The strange creature must have weighed
as much as Cap'n Bill, and as it floundered and struggled to get out of
the water to the sandy beach it was so big and unusual that both Trot and
her companion stared at it in wonder--in wonder that was not unmixed with
fear.

CHAPTER 3

The Ork

The eyes that regarded them, as the creature stood dripping before them,
were bright and mild in expression, and the queer addition to their party
made no attempt to attack them and seemed quite as surprised by the
meeting as they were.

"I wonder," whispered Trot, "what it is."

"Who, me?" exclaimed the creature in a shrill, high-pitched voice. "Why,
I'm an Ork."

"Oh!" said the girl. "But what is an Ork?"

"I am," he repeated, a little proudly, as he shook the water from his
funny wings; "and if ever an Ork was glad to be out of the water and
on dry land again, you can be mighty sure that I'm that especial,
individual Ork!"

"Have you been in the water long?" inquired Cap'n Bill, thinking it only
polite to show an interest in the strange creature..

"Why, this last ducking was about ten minutes, I believe, and that's
about nine minutes and sixty seconds too long for comfort," was the
reply. "But last night I was in an awful pickle, I assure you. The
whirlpool caught me, and--"

"Oh, were you in the whirlpool, too?" asked Trot eagerly.

He gave her a glance that was somewhat reproachful.

"I believe I was mentioning the fact, young lady, when your desire to
talk interrupted me," said the Ork. "I am not usually careless in my
actions, but that whirlpool was so busy yesterday that I thought I'd
see what mischief it was up to. So I flew a little too near it and the
suction of the air drew me down into the depths of the ocean. Water and
I are natural enemies, and it would have conquered me this time had not
a bevy of pretty mermaids come to my assistance and dragged me away from
the whirling water and far up into a cavern, where they deserted me."

"Why, that's about the same thing that happened to us," cried Trot. "Was
your cavern like this one?"

"I haven't examined this one yet," answered the Ork; "but if they happen
to be alike I shudder at our fate, for the other one was a prison,
with no outlet except by means of the water. I stayed there all night,
however, and this morning I plunged into the pool, as far down as I
could go, and then swam as hard and as far as I could. The rocks scraped
my back, now and then, and I barely escaped the clutches of an ugly
sea-monster; but by and by I came to the surface to catch my breath,
and found myself here. That's the whole story, and as I see you have
something to eat I entreat you to give me a share of it. The truth is,
I'm half starved."

With these words the Ork squatted down beside them. Very reluctantly
Cap'n Bill drew another biscuit from his pocket and held it out. The Ork
promptly seized it in one of its front claws and began to nibble the
biscuit in much the same manner a parrot might have done.

"We haven't much grub," said the sailor-man, "but we're willin' to share
it with a comrade in distress."

"That's right," returned the Ork, cocking its head sidewise in a cheerful
manner, and then for a few minutes there was silence while they all ate
of the biscuits. After a while Trot said:

"I've never seen or heard of an Ork before. Are there many of you?"

"We are rather few and exclusive, I believe," was the reply. "In the
country where I was born we are the absolute rulers of all living things,
from ants to elephants."

"What country is that?" asked Cap'n Bill.

"Orkland."

"Where does it lie?"

"I don't know, exactly. You see, I have a restless nature, for some
reason, while all the rest of my race are quiet and contented Orks and
seldom stray far from home. From childhood days I loved to fly long
distances away, although father often warned me that I would get into
trouble by so doing.

"'It's a big world, Flipper, my son,' he would say, 'and I've heard that
in parts of it live queer two-legged creatures called Men, who war upon
all other living things and would have little respect for even an Ork.'

"This naturally aroused my curiosity and after I had completed my
education and left school I decided to fly out into the world and try to
get a glimpse of the creatures called Men. So I left home without saying
good-bye, an act I shall always regret. Adventures were many, I found. I
sighted men several times, but have never before been so close to them
as now. Also I had to fight my way through the air, for I met gigantic
birds, with fluffy feathers all over them, which attacked me fiercely.
Besides, it kept me busy escaping from floating airships. In my rambling
I had lost all track of distance or direction, so that when I wanted to
go home I had no idea where my country was located. I've now been trying
to find it for several months and it was during one of my flights over
the ocean that I met the whirlpool and became its victim."

Trot and Cap'n Bill listened to this recital with much interest, and
from the friendly tone and harmless appearance of the Ork they judged he
was not likely to prove so disagreeable a companion as at first they had
feared he might be.

The Ork sat upon its haunches much as a cat does, but used the
finger-like claws of its front legs almost as cleverly as if they were
hands. Perhaps the most curious thing about the creature was its tail, or
what ought to have been its tail. This queer arrangement of skin, bones
and muscle was shaped like the propellers used on boats and airships,
having fan-like surfaces and being pivoted to its body. Cap'n Bill knew
something of mechanics, and observing the propeller-like tail of the Ork
he said:

"I s'pose you're a pretty swift flyer?"

"Yes, indeed; the Orks are admitted to be Kings of the Air."

"Your wings don't seem to amount to much," remarked Trot.

"Well, they are not very big," admitted the Ork, waving the four hollow
skins gently to and fro, "but they serve to support my body in the air
while I speed along by means of my tail. Still, taken altogether, I'm
very handsomely formed, don't you think?"

Trot did not like to reply, but Cap'n Bill nodded gravely. "For an Ork,"
said he, "you're a wonder. I've never seen one afore, but I can imagine
you're as good as any."

That seemed to please the creature and it began walking around the
cavern, making its way easily up the slope. While it was gone, Trot and
Cap'n Bill each took another sip from the water-flask, to wash down their
breakfast.

"Why, here's a hole--an exit--an outlet!" exclaimed the Ork from above.

"We know," said Trot. "We found it last night."

"Well, then, let's be off," continued the Ork, after sticking its head
into the black hole and sniffing once or twice. "The air seems fresh and
sweet, and it can't lead us to any worse place than this."

[Illustration]

The girl and the sailor-man got up and climbed to the side of the Ork.

"We'd about decided to explore this hole before you came," explained
Cap'n Bill; "but it's a dangerous place to navigate in the dark, so wait
till I light a candle."

"What is a candle?" inquired the Ork.

"You'll see in a minute," said Trot.

The old sailor drew one of the candles from his right-side pocket and the
tin matchbox from his left-side pocket. When he lighted the match the
Ork gave a startled jump and eyed the flame suspiciously; but Cap'n Bill
proceeded to light the candle and the action interested the Ork very much.

"Light," it said, somewhat nervously, "is valuable in a hole of this
sort. The candle is not dangerous, I hope?"

"Sometimes it burns your fingers," answered Trot, "but that's about the
worst it can do--'cept to blow out when you don't want it to."

Cap'n Bill shielded the flame with his hand and crept into the hole. It
wasn't any too big for a grown man, but after he had crawled a few feet
it grew larger. Trot came close behind him and then the Ork followed.

"Seems like a reg'lar tunnel," muttered the sailor-man, who was creeping
along awkwardly because of his wooden leg. The rocks, too, hurt his knees.

For nearly half an hour the three moved slowly along the tunnel, which
made many twists and turns and sometimes slanted downward and sometimes
upward. Finally Cap'n Bill stopped short, with an exclamation of
disappointment, and held the flickering candle far ahead to light the
scene.

"What's wrong?' demanded Trot, who could see nothing because the sailor's
form completely filled the hole.

"Why, we've come to the end of our travels, I guess," he replied.

"Is the hole blocked?" inquired the Ork.

"No; it's wuss nor that," replied Cap'n Bill sadly. "I'm on the edge
of a precipice. Wait a minute an' I'll move along and let you see for
yourselves. Be careful, Trot, not to fall."

Then he crept forward a little and moved to one side, holding the candle
so that the girl could see to follow him. The Ork came next and now all
three knelt on a narrow ledge of rock which dropped straight away and
left a huge black space which the tiny flame of the candle could not
illuminate.

"H-m!" said the Ork, peering over the edge; "this doesn't look very
promising, I'll admit. But let me take your candle, and I'll fly down and
see what's below us."

"Aren't you afraid?" asked Trot.

"Certainly I'm afraid," responded the Ork. "But if we intend to escape
we can't stay on this shelf forever. So, as I notice you poor creatures
cannot fly, it is my duty to explore the place for you."

Cap'n Bill handed the Ork the candle, which had now burned to about half
its length. The Ork took it in one claw rather cautiously and then tipped
its body forward and slipped over the edge. They heard a queer buzzing
sound, as the tail revolved, and a brisk flapping of the peculiar wings,
but they were more interested just then in following with their eyes the
tiny speck of light which marked the location of the candle. This light
first made a great circle, then dropped slowly downward and suddenly was
extinguished, leaving everything before them black as ink.

"Hi, there! How did that happen?" cried the Ork.

"It blew out, I guess," shouted Cap'n Bill. "Fetch it here."

"I can't see where you are," said the Ork.

So Cap'n Bill got out another candle and lighted it, and its flame
enabled the Ork to fly back to them. It alighted on the edge and held out
the bit of candle.

"What made it stop burning?" asked the creature.

"The wind," said Trot. "You must be more careful, this time."

"What's the place like?" inquired Cap'n Bill.

"I don't know, yet; but there must be a bottom to it, so I'll try to find
it."

With this the Ork started out again and this time sank downward more
slowly. Down, down, down it went, till the candle was a mere spark, and
then it headed away to the left and Trot and Cap'n Bill lost all sight of
it.

[Illustration]

In a few minutes, however, they saw the spark of light again, and as the
sailor still held the second lighted candle the Ork made straight toward
them. It was only a few yards distant when suddenly it dropped the
candle with a cry of pain and next moment alighted, fluttering wildly,
upon the rocky ledge.

"What's the matter?" asked Trot.

"It bit me!" wailed the Ork. "I don't like your candles. The thing began
to disappear slowly as soon as I took it in my claw, and it grew smaller
and smaller until just now it turned and bit me--a most unfriendly thing
to do. Oh--oh! Ouch, what a bite!"

"That's the nature of candles, I'm sorry to say," explained Cap'n Bill,
with a grin. "You have to handle 'em mighty keerful. But tell us, what
did you find down there?"

"I found a way to continue our journey," said the Ork, nursing tenderly
the claw which had been burned. "Just below us is a great lake of black
water, which looked so cold and wicked that it made me shudder; but away
at the left there's a big tunnel, which we can easily walk through. I
don't know where it leads to, of course, but we must follow it and find
out."

"Why, we can't get to it," protested the little girl. "We can't fly, as
you do, you must remember."

"No, that's true," replied the Ork musingly.

"Your bodies are built very poorly, it seems to me, since all you can do
is crawl upon the earth's surface. But you may ride upon my back, and in
that way T can promise you a safe journey to the tunnel."

"Are you strong enough to carry us?" asked Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.

"Yes, indeed; I'm strong enough to carry a dozen of you, if you could
find a place to sit," was the reply; "but there's only room between my
wings for one at a time, so I'll have to make two trips."

"All right; I'll go first," decided Cap'n Bill.

He lit another candle for Trot to hold while they were gone and to light
the Ork on his return to her, and then the old sailor got upon the Ork's
back, where he sat with his wooden leg sticking straight out sidewise.

"If you start to fall, clasp your arms around my neck," advised the
creature.

"If I start to fall, it's good night an' pleasant dreams," said Cap'n
Bill.

"All ready?" asked the Ork.

"Start the buzz-tail," said Cap'n Bill, with a tremble in his voice. But
the Ork flew away so gently that the old man never even tottered in his
seat.

Trot watched the light of Cap'n Bill's candle till it disappeared in the
far distance. She didn't like to be left alone on this dangerous ledge,
with a lake of black water hundreds of feet below her; but she was a
brave little girl and waited patiently for the return of the Ork. It came
even sooner than she had expected and the creature said to her:

"Your friend is safe in the tunnel. Now, then, get aboard and I'll carry
you to him in a jiffy."

I'm sure not many little girls would have cared to take that awful ride
through the huge black cavern on the back of a skinny Ork. Trot didn't
care for it, herself, but it just had to be done and so she did it as
courageously as possible. Her heart beat fast and she was so nervous she
could scarcely hold the candle in her fingers as the Ork sped swiftly
through the darkness.

It seemed like a long ride to her, yet in reality the Ork covered the
distance in a wonderfully brief period of time and soon Trot stood
safely beside Cap'n Bill on the level floor of a big arched tunnel. The
sailor-man was very glad to greet his little comrade again and both were
grateful to the Ork for his assistance.

"I dunno where this tunnel leads to," remarked Cap'n Bill, "but it surely
looks more promisin' than that other hole we crept through."

"When the Ork is rested," said Trot, "we'll travel on and see what
happens."

"Rested!" cried the Ork, as scornfully as his shrill voice would allow.
"That bit of flying didn't tire me at all. I'm used to flying days at a
time, without ever once stopping."

"Then let's move on," proposed Cap'n Bill. He still held in his hand one
lighted candle, so Trot blew out the other flame and placed her candle in
the sailor's big pocket. She knew it was not wise to burn two candles at
once.

The tunnel was straight and smooth and very easy to walk through, so they
made good progress. Trot thought that the tunnel began about two miles
from the cavern where they had been cast by the whirlpool, but now it
was impossible to guess the miles traveled, for they walked steadily for
hours and hours without any change in their surroundings.

Finally Cap'n Bill stopped to rest.

"There's somethin' queer about this 'ere tunnel, I'm certain," he
declared, wagging his head dolefully. "Here's three candles gone a'ready,
an' only three more left us, yet the tunnel's the same as it was when we
started. An' how long it's goin' to keep up, no one knows."

"Couldn't we walk without a light?" asked Trot. "The way seems safe
enough."

"It does right now," was the reply, "but we can't tell when we are likely
to come to another gulf, or somethin' jes' as dangerous. In that case
we'd be killed afore we knew it."

"Suppose I go ahead?" suggested the Ork. "I don't fear a fall, you know,
and if anything happens I'll call out and warn you."

"That's a good idea," declared Trot, and Cap'n Bill thought so, too. So
the Ork started off ahead, quite in the dark, and hand in hand the two
followed him.

When they had walked in this way for a good long time the Ork halted and
demanded food. Cap'n Bill had not mentioned food because there was so
little left--only three biscuits and a lump of cheese about as big as his
two fingers--but he gave the Ork half of a biscuit, sighing as he did so.
The creature didn't care for the cheese, so the sailor divided it between
himself and Trot. They lighted a candle and sat down in the tunnel while
they ate.

"My feet hurt me," grumbled the Ork. "I'm not used to walking and this
rocky passage is so uneven and lumpy that it hurts me to walk upon it."

"Can't you fly along?" asked Trot.

"No; the roof is too low," said the Ork.

After the meal they resumed their journey, which Trot began to fear would
never end. When Cap'n Bill noticed how tired the little girl was, he
paused and lighted a match and looked at his big silver watch.

"Why, it's night!" he exclaimed. "We've tramped all day, an' still we're
in this awful passage, which mebbe goes straight through the middle of
the world, an' mebbe is a circle--in which case we can keep walkin' till
doomsday. Not knowin' what's before us so well as we know what's behind
us, I propose we make a stop, now, an' try to sleep till mornin'."

"That will suit me," asserted the Ork, with a groan. "My feet are hurting
me dreadfully and for the last few miles I've been limping with pain."

"My foot hurts, too," said the sailor, looking for a smooth place on the
rocky floor to sit down.

"_Your_ foot!" cried the Ork. "Why, you've only one to hurt you, while I
have four. So I suffer four times as much as you possibly can. Here; hold
the candle while I look at the bottoms of my claws. I declare," he said,
examining them by the flickering light, "there are bunches of pain all
over them!"

"P'r'aps," said Trot, who was very glad to sit down beside her
companions, "you've got corns."

"Corns? Nonsense! Orks never have corns," protested the creature, rubbing
its sore feet tenderly.

"Then mebbe they're--they're--What do you call 'em, Cap'n Bill? Something
'bout the Pilgrim's Progress, you know."

"Bunions," said Cap'n Bill.

"Oh, yes; mebbe you've got bunions."

"It is possible," moaned the Ork. "But whatever they are, another day of
such walking on them would drive me crazy."

"I'm sure they'll feel better by mornin'," said Cap'n Bill,
encouragingly. "Go to sleep an' try to forget your sore feet."

The Ork cast a reproachful look at the sailor-man, who didn't see it.
Then the creature asked plaintively: "Do we eat now, or do we starve?"

"There's only half a biscuit left for you," answered Cap'n Bill. "No one
knows how long we'll have to stay in this dark tunnel, where there's
nothing whatever to eat; so I advise you to save that morsel o' food till
later."

"Give it me now!" demanded the Ork. "If I'm going to starve, I'll do it
all at once--not by degrees."

Cap'n Bill produced the biscuit and the creature ate it in a trice. Trot
was rather hungry and whispered to Cap'n Bill that she'd take part of
her share; but the old man secretly broke his own half-biscuit in two,
saving Trot's share for a time of greater need.

He was beginning to be worried over the little girl's plight and long
after she was asleep and the Ork was snoring in a rather disagreeable
manner, Cap'n Bill sat with his back to a rock and smoked his pipe and
tried to think of some way to escape from this seemingly endless tunnel.
But after a time he also slept, for hobbling on a wooden leg all day was
tiresome, and there in the dark slumbered the three adventurers for many
hours, until the Ork roused itself and kicked the old sailor with one
foot.

"It must be another day," said he.

CHAPTER 4

Daylight at Last


Cap'n Bill rubbed his eyes, lit a match and consulted his watch.

"Nine o'clock. Yes, I guess it's another day, sure enough. Shall we go
on?' he asked.

"Of course," replied the Ork. "Unless this tunnel is different from
everything else in the world, and has no end, we'll find a way out of it
sooner or later."

The sailor gently wakened Trot. She felt much rested by her long sleep
and sprang to her feet eagerly.

"Let's start, Cap'n," was all she said.

They resumed the journey and had only taken a few steps when the Ork
cried "Wow!" and made a great fluttering of its wings and whirling of
its tail. The others, who were following a short distance behind, stopped
abruptly.

"What's the matter?" asked Cap'n Bill.

"Give us a light," was the reply. "I think we've come to the end of the
tunnel." Then, while Cap'n Bill lighted a candle, the creature added: "If
that is true, we needn't have wakened so soon, for we were almost at the
end of this place when we went to sleep."

The sailor-man and Trot came forward with a light. A wall of rock really
faced the tunnel, but now they saw that the opening made a sharp turn
to the left. So they followed on, by a narrower passage, and then made
another sharp turn--this time to the right.

"Blow out the light, Cap'n," said the Ork, in a pleased voice. "We've
struck daylight."

Daylight at last! A shaft of mellow light fell almost at their feet as
Trot and the sailor turned the corner of the passage, but it came from
above, and raising their eyes they found they were at the bottom of a
deep, rocky well, with the top far, far above their heads. And here the
passage ended.

[Illustration]

For a while they gazed in silence, at least two of them being filled
with dismay at the sight. But the Ork merely whistled softly and said
cheerfully:

"That was the toughest journey I ever had the misfortune to undertake,
and I'm glad it's over. Yet, unless I can manage to fly to the top of
this pit, we are entombed here forever."

"Do you think there is room enough for you to fly in?" asked the little
girl anxiously; and Cap'n Bill added:

"It's a straight-up shaft, so I don't see how you'll ever manage it."

"Were I an ordinary bird--one of those horrid feathered things--I
wouldn't even make the attempt to fly out," said the Ork. "But my
mechanical propeller tail can accomplish wonders, and whenever you're
ready I'll show you a trick that is worth while."

"Oh!" exclaimed Trot; "do you intend to take us up, too?"

"Why not?"

"I thought," said Cap'n Bill, "as you'd go first, an' then send somebody
to help us by lettin' down a rope."

"Ropes are dangerous," replied the Ork, "and I might not be able to find
one to reach all this distance. Besides, it stands to reason that if I
can get out myself I can also carry you two with me."

"Well, I'm not afraid," said Trot, who longed to be on the earth's
surface again.

"S'pose we fall?'' suggested Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.

"Why, in that case we would all fall together," returned the Ork. "Get
aboard, little girl; sit across my shoulders and put both your arms
around my neck."

Trot obeyed and when she was seated on the Ork, Cap'n Bill inquired:

"How 'bout me, Mr. Ork?"

"Why, I think you'd best grab hold of my rear legs and let me carry you
up in that manner," was the reply.

Cap'n Bill looked way up at the top of the well, and then he looked at
the Ork's slender, skinny legs and heaved a deep sigh.

"It's goin' to be some dangle, I guess; but if you don't waste too much
time on the way up, I may be able to hang on," said he.

"All ready, then!" cried the Ork, and at once his whirling tail began
to revolve. Trot felt herself rising into the air; when the creature's
legs left the ground Cap'n Bill grasped two of them firmly and held
on for dear life. The Ork's body was tipped straight upward, and Trot
had to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off. Even in
this position the Ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the
well. Several times it exclaimed "Wow!" as it bumped its back, or a wing
hit against some jagged projection; but the tail kept whirling with
remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter. It was,
indeed, a long journey from the bottom to the top, yet almost before Trot
realized they had come so far, they popped out of the hole into the clear
air and sunshine and a moment later the Ork alighted gently upon the
ground.

[Illustration]

The release was so sudden that even with the creature's care for its
passengers Cap'n Bill struck the earth with a shock that sent him rolling
heel over head; but by the time Trot had slid down from her seat the old
sailor-man was sitting up and looking around him with much satisfaction.

"It's sort o' pretty here," said he.

"Earth is a beautiful place!" cried Trot.

"I wonder where on earth we are?' pondered the Ork, turning first one
bright eye and then the other to this side and that. Trees there were, in
plenty, and shrubs and flowers and green turf. But there were no houses;
there were no paths; there was no sign of civilization whatever.

"Just before I settled down on the ground I thought I caught a view of
the ocean," said the Ork. "Let's see if I was right." Then he flew to a
little hill, near by, and Trot and Cap'n Bill followed him more slowly.
When they stood on the top of the hill they could see the blue waves of
the ocean in front of them, to the right of them, and at the left of
them. Behind the hill was a forest that shut out the view.

"I hope it ain't an island, Trot," said Cap'n Bill gravely.

"If it is, I s'pose we're prisoners," she replied.

"Ezzackly so, Trot."

"But, even so, it's better than those terr'ble underground tunnels and
caverns," declared the girl.

"You are right, little one," agreed the Ork. "Anything above ground is
better than the best that lies under ground. So let's not quarrel with
our fate but be thankful we've escaped."

"We are, indeed!" she replied. "But I wonder if we can find something to
eat in this place?"

"Let's explore an' find out," proposed Cap'n Bill. "Those trees over at
the left look like cherry-trees."

On the way to them the explorers had to walk through a tangle of vines
and Cap'n Bill, who went first, stumbled and pitched forward on his face.

"Why, it's a melon!" cried Trot delightedly, as she saw what had caused
the sailor to fall.

[Illustration]

Cap'n Bill rose to his foot, for he was not at all hurt, and examined the
melon. Then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the melon
open. It was quite ripe and looked delicious; but the old man tasted
it before he permitted Trot to eat any. Deciding it was good he gave
her a big slice and then offered the Ork some. The creature looked at
the fruit somewhat disdainfully, at first, but once he had tasted its
flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others. Among the vines they
discovered many other melons, and Trot said gratefully: "Well, there's no
danger of our starving, even if this _is_ an island."

"Melons," remarked Cap'n Bill, "are both food an' water. We couldn't have
struck anything better."

Farther on they came to the cherry-trees, where they obtained some of the
fruit, and at the edge of the little forest were wild plums. The forest
itself consisted entirely of nut trees--walnuts, filberts, almonds and
chestnuts--so there would be plenty of wholesome food for them while they
remained there.

Cap'n Bill and Trot decided to walk through the forest, to discover what
was on the other side of it, but the Ork's feet were still so sore and
"lumpy" from walking on the rocks that the creature said he preferred to
fly over the tree-tops and meet them on the other side. The forest was
not large, so by walking briskly for fifteen minutes they reached its
farthest edge and saw before them the shore of the ocean.

"It's an island, all right," said Trot, with a sigh.

"Yes, and a pretty island, too," said Cap'n Bill, trying to conceal his
disappointment on Trot's account. "I guess, partner, if the wuss comes to
the wuss, I could build a raft--or even a boat--from those trees, so's
we could sail away in it."

The little girl brightened at this suggestion.

"I don't see the Ork anywhere," she remarked, looking around. Then her
eyes lighted upon something and she exclaimed: "Oh, Cap'n Bill! Isn't
that a house, over there to the left?"

Cap'n Bill, looking closely, saw a shed-like structure built at one edge
of the forest.

"Seems like it, Trot. Not that I'd call it much of a house, but it's a
buildin', all right. Let's go over an' see if it's occypied."

CHAPTER 5

The Little Old Man of the Island


A few steps brought them to the shed, which was merely a roof of boughs
built over a square space, with some branches of trees fastened to the
sides to keep off the wind. The front was quite open and faced the sea,
and as our friends came nearer they observed a little man, with a long
pointed beard, sitting motionless on a stool and staring thoughtfully out
over the water.

"Get out of the way, please," he called in a fretful voice. "Can't you
see you are obstructing my view?"

"Good morning," said Cap'n Bill, politely.

"It isn't a good morning!" snapped the little man. "I've seen plenty
of mornings better than this. Do you call it a good morning when I'm
pestered with such a crowd as you?"

Trot was astonished to hear such words from a stranger whom they had
greeted quite properly, and Cap'n Bill grew red at the little man's
rudeness. But the sailor said, in a quiet tone of voice:

"Are you the only one as lives on this 'ere island?"

"Your grammar's bad," was the reply. "But this is my own exclusive
island, and I'll thank you to get off it as soon as possible."

"We'd like to do that," said Trot, and then she and Cap'n Bill turned
away and walked down to the shore, to see if any other land was in sight.

The little man rose and followed them, although both were now too
provoked to pay any attention to him.

"Nothin' in sight, partner," reported Cap'n Bill, shading his eyes with
his hand; "so we'll have to stay here for a time, anyhow. It isn't a bad
place, Trot, by any means."

"That's all you know about it!" broke in the little man. "The trees are
altogether too green and the rocks are harder than they ought to be. I
find the sand very grainy and the water dreadfully wet. Every breeze
makes a draught and the sun shines in the daytime, when there's no need
of it, and disappears just as soon as it begins to get dark. If you
remain here you'll find the island very unsatisfactory."

Trot turned to look at him, and her sweet face was grave and curious.

"I wonder who you are," she said.

"My name is Pessim," said he, with an air of pride. "I'm called the
Observer."

"Oh. What do you observe?" asked the little girl.

"Everything I see," was the reply, in a more surly tone. Then Pessim drew
back with a startled exclamation and looked at some footprints in the
sand. "Why, good gracious me!' he cried in distress.

"What's the matter now?' asked Cap'n Bill.

"Someone has pushed the earth in! Don't you see it?"

"It isn't pushed in far enough to hurt anything," said Trot, examining
the footprints.

"Everything hurts that isn't right," insisted the man. "If the earth were
pushed in a mile, it would be a great calamity, wouldn't it?"

"I s'pose so," admitted the little girl.

"Well, here it is pushed in a full inch! That's a twelfth of a foot,
or a little more than a millionth part of a mile. Therefore it is
one-millionth part of a calamity--Oh, dear! How dreadful!" said Pessim in
a wailing voice.

"Try to forget it, sir," advised Cap'n Bill, soothingly. "It's beginning
to rain. Let's get under your shed and keep dry."

"Raining! Is it really raining?' asked Pessim, beginning to weep.

"It is," answered Cap'n Bill, as the drops began to descend, "and I don't
see any way to stop it--although I'm some observer myself."

"No; we can't stop it, I fear," said the man. "Are you very busy just
now?"

"I won't be after I get to the shed," replied the sailor-man.

"Then do me a favor, please," begged Pessim, walking briskly along behind
them, for they were hastening to the shed.

"Depends on what it is," said Cap'n Bill.

"I wish you would take my umbrella down to the shore and hold it over
the poor fishes till it stops raining. I'm afraid they'll get wet," said
Pessim.

Trot laughed, but Cap'n Bill thought the little man was poking fun at him
and so he scowled upon Pessim in a way that showed he was angry.

They reached the shed before getting very wet, although the rain was now
coming down in big drops. The roof of the shed protected them and while
they stood watching the rainstorm something buzzed in and circled around
Pessim's head. At once the Observer began beating it away with his hands,
crying out:

"A bumblebee! A bumblebee! The queerest bumblebee I ever saw!"

Cap'n Bill and Trot both looked at it and the little girl said in
surprise:

"Dear me! It's a wee little Ork!"

"That's what it is, sure enough," exclaimed Cap'n Bill.

Really, it wasn't much bigger than a big bumblebee, and when it came
toward Trot she allowed it to alight on her shoulder.

"It's me, all right," said a very small voice in her ear; "but I'm in an
awful pickle, just the same!"

"What, are you _our_ Ork, then?" demanded the girl, much amazed.

"No, I'm my own Ork. But I'm the only Ork you know," replied the tiny
creature.

"What's happened to you?" asked the sailor, putting his head close to
Trot's shoulder in order to hear the reply better. Pessim also put his
head close, and the Ork said:

[Illustration]

"You will remember that when I left you I started to fly over the trees,
and just as I got to this side of the forest I saw a bush that was loaded
down with the most luscious fruit you can imagine. The fruit was about
the size of a gooseberry and of a lovely lavender color. So I swooped
down and picked off one in my bill and ate it. At once I began to grow
small. I could feel myself shrinking, shrinking away, and it frightened
me terribly, so that I alighted on the ground to think over what was
happening. In a few seconds I had shrunk to the size you now see me;
but there I remained, getting no smaller, indeed, but no larger. It is
certainly a dreadful affliction! After I had recovered somewhat from the
shock I began to search for you. It is not so easy to find one's way when
a creature is so small, but fortunately I spied you here in this shed and
came to you at once."

Cap'n Bill and Trot were much astonished at this story and felt grieved
for the poor Ork, but the little man Pessim seemed to think it a good
joke. He began laughing when he heard the story and laughed until he
choked, after which he lay down on the ground and rolled and laughed
again, while the tears of merriment coursed down his wrinkled cheeks.

"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he finally gasped, sitting up and wiping his eyes.
"This is too rich! It's almost too joyful to be true."

"I don't see anything funny about it," remarked Trot indignantly.

"You would if you'd had my experience," said Pessim, getting upon his
feet and gradually resuming his solemn and dissatisfied expression of
countenance. "The same thing happened to me."

"Oh, did it? And how did you happen to come to this island?" asked the
girl.

"I didn't come; the neighbors brought me," replied the little man, with a
frown at the recollection. "They said I was quarrelsome and fault-finding
and blamed me because I told them all the things that went wrong, or
never were right, and because I told them how things ought to be. So they
brought me here and left me all alone, saying that if I quarreled with
myself, no one else would be made unhappy. Absurd, wasn't it?"

"Seems to me," said Cap'n Bill, "those neighbors did the proper thing."

"Well," resumed Pessim, "when I found myself King of this island I
was obliged to live upon fruits, and I found many fruits growing here
that I had never seen before. I tasted several and found them good and
wholesome. But one day I ate a lavender berry--as the Ork did--and
immediately I grew so small that I was scarcely two inches high. It was a
very unpleasant condition and like the Ork I became frightened. I could
not walk very well nor very far, for every lump of earth in my way seemed
a mountain, every blade of grass a tree and every grain of sand a rocky
boulder. For several days I stumbled around in an agony of fear. Once a
tree toad nearly gobbled me up, and if I ran out from the shelter of the
bushes the gulls and cormorants swooped down upon me. Finally I decided
to eat another berry and become nothing at all, since life, to one as
small as I was, had become a dreary nightmare.

"At last I found a small tree that I thought bore the same fruit as that
I had eaten. The berry was dark purple instead of light lavender, but
otherwise it was quite similar. Being unable to climb the tree, I was
obliged to wait underneath it until a sharp breeze arose and shook the
limbs so that a berry fell. Instantly I seized it and taking a last view
of the world--as I then thought--I ate the berry in a twinkling. Then,
to my surprise, I began to grow big again, until I became of my former
stature, and so I have since remained. Needless to say, I have never
eaten again of the lavender fruit, nor do any of the beasts or birds that
live upon this island eat it."

They had all three listened eagerly to this amazing tale, and when it was
finished the Ork exclaimed:

"Do you think, then, that the deep purple berry is the antidote for the
lavender one?"

"I'm sure of it," answered Pessim. "Then lead me to the tree at once!"
begged the Ork, "for this tiny form I now have terrifies me greatly."

Pessim examined the Ork closely.

[Illustration]

"You are ugly enough as you are," said he. "Were you any larger you might
be dangerous."

"Oh, no," Trot assured him; "the Ork has been our good friend. Please
take us to the tree."

Then Pessim consented, although rather reluctantly. He led them to the
right, which was the east side of the island, and in a few minutes
brought them near to the edge of the grove which faced the shore of the
ocean. Here stood a small tree bearing berries of a deep purple color.
The fruit looked very enticing and Cap'n Bill reached up and selected one
that seemed especially plump and ripe.

The Ork had remained perched upon Trot's shoulder but now it flew down
to the ground. It was so difficult for Cap'n Bill to kneel down, with
his wooden leg, that the little girl took the berry from him and held it
close to the Ork's head.

"It's too big to go into my mouth," said the little creature, looking at
the fruit sidewise.

"You'll have to make sev'ral mouthfuls of it, I guess," said Trot; and
that is what the Ork did. He pecked at the soft, ripe fruit with his bill
and ate it up very quickly, because it was good.

Even before he had finished the berry they could see the Ork begin to
grow. In a few minutes he had regained his natural size and was strutting
before them, quite delighted with his transformation.

"Well, well! What do you think of me now?" he asked proudly.

"You are very skinny and remarkably ugly," declared Pessim.
