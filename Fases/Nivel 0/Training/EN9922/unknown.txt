      LEDA
  BROWN and bright as an agate, mountain-cool,
  Eurotas singing slips from pool to pool;
  Down rocky gullies; through the cavernous pines
  And chestnut groves; down where the terraced vines
  And gardens overhang; through valleys grey
  With olive trees, into a soundless bay
  Of the Ægean. Silent and asleep
  Lie those pools now: but where they dream most deep,
  Men sometimes see ripples of shining hair
  And the young grace of bodies pale and bare,
  Shimmering far down—the ghosts these mirrors hold
  Of all the beauty they beheld of old,
  White limbs and heavenly eyes and the hair’s river of gold,
  For once these banks were peopled: Spartan girls
  Loosed here their maiden girdles and their curls,
  And stooping o’er the level water stole
  His darling mirror from the sun through whole
  Rapturous hours of gazing.
                                  The first star
  Of all this milky constellation, far
  Lovelier than any nymph of wood or green,
  Was she whom Tyndarus had made his queen
  For her sheer beauty and subtly moving grace—
  Leda, the fairest of our mortal race.

  Hymen had lit his torches but one week
  About her bed (and still o’er her young cheek
  Passed rosy shadows of those thoughts that sped
  Across her mind, still virgin, still unwed,
  For all her body was her own no more),
  When Leda with her maidens to the shore
  Of bright Eurotas came, to escape the heat
  Of summer noon in waters coolly sweet.
  By a brown pool which opened smooth and clear
  Below the wrinkled water of a weir
  They sat them down under an old fir-tree
  To rest: and to the laughing melody
  Of their sweet speech the river’s rippling bore
  A liquid burden, while the sun did pour
  Pure colour out of heaven upon the earth.
  The meadows seethed with the incessant mirth
  Of grasshoppers, seen only when they flew
  Their curves of scarlet or sudden dazzling blue.
  Within the fir-tree’s round of unpierced shade
  The maidens sat with laughter and talk, or played,
  Gravely intent, their game of knuckle-bones;
  Or tossed from hand to hand the old dry cones
  Littered about the tree. And one did sing
  A ballad of some far-off Spartan king,
  Who took a wife, but left her, well-away!
  Slain by his foes upon their wedding-day.
  “That was a piteous story,” Leda sighed,
  “To be a widow ere she was a bride.”
  “Better,” said one, “to live a virgin life
  Alone, and never know the name of wife
  And bear the ugly burden of a child
  And have great pain by it. Let me live wild,
  A bird untamed by man!” “Nay,” cried another,
  “I would be wife, if I should not be mother.
  Cypris I honour; let the vulgar pay
  Their gross vows to Lucina when they pray.
  Our finer spirits would be blunted quite
  By bestial teeming; but Love’s rare delight
  Wings the rapt soul towards Olympus’ height.”
  “Delight?” cried Leda. “Love to me has brought
  Nothing but pain and a world of shameful thought.
  When they say love is sweet, the poets lie;
  ’Tis but a trick to catch poor maidens by.
  What are their boasted pleasures? I am queen
  To the most royal king the world has seen;
  Therefore I should, if any woman might,
  Know at its full that exquisite delight.
  Yet these few days since I was made a wife
  Have held more bitterness than all my life,
  While I was yet a child.” The great bright tears
  Slipped through her lashes. “Oh, my childish years!
  Years that were all my own, too sadly few,
  When I was happy—and yet never knew
  How happy till to-day!” Her maidens came
  About her as she wept, whispering her name,
  Leda, sweet Leda, with a hundred dear
  Caressing words to soothe her heavy cheer.
  At last she started up with a fierce pride
  Upon her face. “I am a queen,” she cried,
  “But had forgotten it a while; and you,
  Wenches of mine, you were forgetful too.
  Undress me. We would bathe ourself.” So proud
  A queen she stood, that all her maidens bowed
  In trembling fear and scarcely dared approach
  To do her bidding. But at last the brooch
  Pinned at her shoulder is undone, the wide
  Girdle of silk beneath her breasts untied;
  The tunic falls about her feet, and she
  Steps from the crocus folds of drapery,
  Dazzlingly naked, into the warm sun.
  God-like she stood; then broke into a run,
  Leaping and laughing in the light, as though
  Life through her veins coursed with so swift a flow
  Of generous blood and fire that to remain
  Too long in statued queenliness were pain
  To that quick soul, avid of speed and joy.
  She ran, easily bounding, like a boy,
  Narrow of haunch and slim and firm of breast.
  Lovelier she seemed in motion than at rest,
  If that might be, when she was never less,
  Moving or still, than perfect loveliness.
  At last, with cheeks afire and heaving flank,
  She checked her race, and on the river’s bank
  Stood looking down at her own echoed shape
  And at the fish that, aimlessly agape,
  Hung midway up their heaven of flawless glass,
  Like angels waiting for eternity to pass.
  Leda drew breath and plunged; her gasping cry
  Splashed up; the water circled brokenly
  Out from that pearly shudder of dipped limbs;
  The glittering pool laughed up its flowery brims,
  And everything, save the poor fish, rejoiced:
  Their idiot contemplation of the Moist,
  The Cold, the Watery, was in a trice
  Ended when Leda broke their crystal paradise.

  Jove in his high Olympian chamber lay
  Hugely supine, striving to charm away
  In sleep the long, intolerable noon.
  But heedless Morpheus still withheld his boon,
  And Jove upon his silk-pavilioned bed
  Tossed wrathful and awake. His fevered head
  Swarmed with a thousand fancies, which forecast
  Delights to be, or savoured pleasures past.
  Closing his eyes, he saw his eagle swift,
  Headlong as his own thunder, stoop and lift
  On pinions upward labouring the prize
  Of beauty ravished for the envious skies.
  He saw again that bright, adulterous pair,
  Trapped by the limping husband unaware,
  Fast in each other’s arms, and faster in the snare—
  And laughed remembering. Sometimes his thought
  Went wandering over the earth and sought
  Familiar places—temples by the sea,
  Cities and islands; here a sacred tree
  And there a cavern of shy nymphs.
                                    He rolled
  About his bed, in many a rich fold
  Crumpling his Babylonian coverlet,
  And yawned and stretched. The smell of his own sweat
  Brought back to mind his Libyan desert-fane
  Of mottled granite, with its endless train
  Of pilgrim camels, reeking towards the sky
  Ammonian incense to his hornèd deity;
  The while their masters worshipped, offering
  Huge teeth of ivory, while some would bring
  Their Ethiop wives—sleek wineskins of black silk,
  Jellied and huge from drinking asses’ milk
  Through years of tropical idleness, to pray
  For offspring (whom he ever sent away
  With prayers unanswered, lest their ebon race
  Might breed and blacken the earth’s comely face).
  Noon pressed on him a hotter, heavier weight.
  O Love in Idleness! how celibate
  He felt! Libido like a nemesis
  Scourged him with itching memories of bliss.
  The satin of imagined skin was sleek
  And supply warm against his lips and cheek,
  And deep within soft hair’s dishevelled dusk
  His eyelids fluttered; like a flowery musk
  The scent of a young body seemed to float
  Faintly about him, close and yet remote—
  For perfume and the essence of music dwell
  In other worlds among the asphodel
  Of unembodied life. Then all had flown;
  His dream had melted. In his bed, alone,
  Jove sweating lay and moaned, and longed in vain
  To still the pulses of his burning pain.
  In sheer despair at last he leapt from bed,
  Opened the window and thrust forth his head
  Into Olympian ether. One fierce frown
  Rifted the clouds, and he was looking down
  Into a gulf of azure calm; the rack
  Seethed round about, tempestuously black;
  But the god’s eye could hold its angry thunders back.
  There lay the world, down through the chasméd blue,
  Stretched out from edge to edge unto his view;
  And in the midst, bright as a summer’s day
  At breathless noon, the Mediterranean lay;
  And Ocean round the world’s dim fringes tossed
  His glaucous waves in mist and distance lost;
  And Pontus and the livid Caspian Sea
  Stirred in their nightmare sleep uneasily.
  And ’twixt the seas rolled the wide fertile land,
  Dappled with green and tracts of tawny sand,
  And rich, dark fallows and fields of flowers aglow
  And the white, changeless silences of snow;
  While here and there towns, like a living eye
  Unclosed on earth’s blind face, towards the sky
  Glanced their bright conscious beauty. Yet the sight
  Of his fair earth gave him but small delight
  Now in his restlessness: its beauty could
  Do nought to quench the fever in his blood.
  Desire lends sharpness to his searching eyes;
  Over the world his focused passion flies
  Quicker than chasing sunlight on a day
  Of storm and golden April. Far away
  He sees the tranquil rivers of the East,
  Mirrors of many a strange barbaric feast,
  Where un-Hellenic dancing-girls contort
  Their yellow limbs, and gibbering masks make sport
  Under the moons of many-coloured light
  That swing their lantern-fruitage in the night
  Of overarching trees. To him it seems
  An alien world, peopled by insane dreams.
  But these are nothing to the monstrous shapes—
  Not men so much as bastardy of apes—
  That meet his eyes in Africa. Between
  Leaves of grey fungoid pulp and poisonous green,
  White eyes from black and browless faces stare.
  Dryads with star-flowers in their woolly hair
  Dance to the flaccid clapping of their own
  Black dangling dugs through forests overgrown,
  Platted with writhing creepers. Horrified,
  He sees them how they leap and dance, or glide,
  Glimpse after black glimpse of a satin skin,
  Among unthinkable flowers, to pause and grin
  Out through a trellis of suppurating lips,
  Of mottled tentacles barbed at the tips
  And bloated hands and wattles and red lobes
  Of pendulous gristle and enormous probes
  Of pink and slashed and tasselled flesh . . .
                                        He turns
  Northward his sickened sight. The desert burns
  All life away. Here in the forkéd shade
  Of twin-humped towering dromedaries laid,
  A few gaunt folk are sleeping: fierce they seem
  Even in sleep, and restless as they dream.
  He would be fearful of a desert bride
  As of a brown asp at his sleeping side,
  Fearful of her white teeth and cunning arts.
  Further, yet further, to the ultimate parts
  Of the wide earth he looks, where Britons go
  Painted among their swamps, and through the snow
  Huge hairy snuffling beasts pursue their prey—
  Fierce men, as hairy and as huge as they.

  Bewildered furrows deepen the Thunderer’s scowl;
  This world so vast, so variously foul—
  Who can have made its ugliness? In what
  Revolting fancy were the Forms begot
  Of all these monsters? What strange deity—
  So barbarously not a Greek!—was he
  Who could mismake such beings in his own
  Distorted image. Nay, the Greeks alone
  Were men; in Greece alone were bodies fair,
  Minds comely. In that all-but-island there,
  Cleaving the blue sea with its promontories,
  Lies the world’s hope, the seed of all the glories
  That are to be; there, too, must surely live
  She who alone can medicinably give
  Ease with her beauty to the Thunderer’s pain.
  Downwards he bends his fiery eyes again,
  Glaring on Hellas. Like a beam of light,
  His intent glances touch the mountain height
  With passing flame and probe the valleys deep,
  Rift the dense forest and the age-old sleep
  Of vaulted antres on whose pebbly floor
  Gallop the loud-hoofed Centaurs; and the roar
  Of more than human shouting underground
  Pulses in living palpable waves of sound
  From wall to wall, until it rumbles out
  Into the air; and at that hollow shout
  That seems an utterance of the whole vast hill,
  The shepherds cease their laughter and are still.
  Cities asleep under the noonday sky
  Stir at the passage of his burning eye;
  And in their huts the startled peasants blink
  At the swift flash that bursts through every chink
  Of wattled walls, hearkening in fearful wonder
  Through lengthened seconds for the crash of thunder—
  Which follows not: they are the more afraid.
  Jove seeks amain. Many a country maid,
  Whose sandalled feet pass down familiar ways
  Among the olives, but whose spirit strays
  Through lovelier lands of fancy, suddenly
  Starts broad awake out of her dream to see
  A light that is not of the sun, a light
  Darted by living eyes, consciously bright;
  She sees and feels it like a subtle flame
  Mantling her limbs with fear and maiden shame
  And strange desire. Longing and terrified,
  She hides her face, like a new-wedded bride
  Who feels rough hands that seize and hold her fast;
  And swooning falls. The terrible light has passed;
  She wakes; the sun still shines, the olive trees
  Tremble to whispering silver in the breeze
  And all is as it was, save she alone
  In whose dazed eyes this deathless light has shone:
  For never, never from this day forth will she
  In earth’s poor passion find felicity,
  Or love of mortal man. A god’s desire
  Has seared her soul; nought but the same strong fire
  Can kindle the dead ash to life again,
  And all her years will be a lonely pain.

  Many a thousand had he looked upon,
  Thousands of mortals, young and old; but none—
  Virgin, or young ephebus, or the flower
  Of womanhood culled in its full-blown hour—
  Could please the Thunderer’s sight or touch his mind;
  The longed-for loveliness was yet to find.
  Had beauty fled, and was there nothing fair
  Under the moon? The fury of despair
  Raged in the breast of heaven’s Almighty Lord;
  He gnashed his foamy teeth and rolled and roared
  In bull-like agony. Then a great calm
  Descended on him: cool and healing balm
  Touched his immortal fury. He had spied
  Young Leda where she stood, poised on the river-side.

  Even as she broke the river’s smooth expanse,
  Leda was conscious of that hungry glance,
  And knew it for an eye of fearful power
  That did so hot and thunderously lour,
  She knew not whence, on her frail nakedness.
  Jove’s heart held but one thought: he must possess
  That perfect form or die—possess or die.
  Unheeded prayers and supplications fly,
  Thick as a flock of birds, about his ears,
  And smoke of incense rises; but he hears
  Nought but the soft falls of that melody
  Which is the speech of Leda; he can see
  Nought but that almost spiritual grace
  Which is her body, and that heavenly face
  Where gay, sweet thoughts shine through, and eyes are bright
  With purity and the soul’s inward light.
  Have her he must: the teasel-fingered burr
  Sticks not so fast in a wild beast’s tangled fur
  As that insistent longing in the soul
  Of mighty Jove. Gods, men, earth, heaven, the whole
  Vast universe was blotted from his thought
  And nought remained but Leda’s laughter, nought
  But Leda’s eyes. Magnified by his lust,
  She was the whole world now; have her he must, he must . . .
  His spirit worked; how should he gain his end
  With most deliciousness? What better friend,
  What counsellor more subtle could he find
  Than lovely Aphrodite, ever kind
  To hapless lovers, ever cunning, too,
  In all the tortuous ways of love to do
  And plan the best? To Paphos then! His will
  And act were one; and straight, invisible,
  He stood in Paphos, breathing the languid air
  By Aphrodite’s couch. O heavenly fair
  She was, and smooth and marvellously young!
  On Tyrian silk she lay, and purple hung
  About her bed in folds of fluted light
  And shadow, dark as wine. Two doves, more white
  Even than the white hand on the purple lying
  Like a pale flower wearily dropped, were flying
  With wings that made an odoriferous stir,
  Dropping faint dews of bakkaris and myrrh,
  Musk and the soul of sweet flowers cunningly
  Ravished from transient petals as they die.
  Two stripling cupids on her either hand
  Stood near with winnowing plumes and gently fanned
  Her hot, love-fevered cheeks and eyelids burning.
  Another, crouched at the bed’s foot, was turning
  A mass of scattered parchments—vows or plaints
  Or glad triumphant thanks which Venus’ saints,
  Martyrs and heroes, on her altars strewed
  With bitterest tears or gifts of gratitude.
  From the pile heaped at Aphrodite’s feet
  The boy would take a leaf, and in his sweet,
  Clear voice would read what mortal tongues can tell
  In stammering verse of those ineffable
  Pleasures and pains of love, heaven and uttermost hell.
  Jove hidden stood and heard him read these lines
  Of votive thanks—
      Cypris, this little silver lamp to thee
        I dedicate.
      It was my fellow-watcher, shared with me
      Those swift, short hours, when raised above my fate
      In Sphenura’s white arms I drank
        Of immortality.
  “A pretty lamp, and I will have it placed
  Beside the narrow bed of some too chaste
  Sister of virgin Artemis, to be
  A night-long witness of her cruelty.
  Read me another, boy,” and Venus bent
  Her ear to listen to this short lament.
      Cypris, Cypris, I am betrayed!
      Under the same wide mantle laid
      I found them, faithless, shameless pair!
      Making love with tangled hair.
  “Alas,” the goddess cried, “nor god, nor man,
  Nor medicinable balm, nor magic can
  Cast out the demon jealousy, whose breath
  Withers the rose of life, save only time and death.”
  Another sheet he took and read again.
      Farewell to love, and hail the long, slow pain
      Of memory that backward turns to joy.
      O I have danced enough and enough sung;
      My feet shall be still now and my voice mute;
      Thine are these withered wreaths, this Lydian flute,
        Cypris; I once was young.
  And piêtous Aphrodite wept to think
  How fadingly upon death’s very brink
